<div>Businessmen who preach that businesses should have a ""social conscience"" are preaching ""pure and unadulterated socialism"". Defending philanthropy as a cornerstone of free enterprise makes you an unwitting puppets controlled by intellectual forces which are undermining free society.</div>
<div>It's difficult to assess how well a leader leads, but indisputable that they contractually agreed to do exactly that.</div>
<div>If an individual believes in giving to organizations, those are the social responsibilities of the person, not their company. If social responsibility is not pure rhetoric, we understand that socially responsible companies must by definition do something against the interests of their shareholders. Committing to socially responsible causes means taking money from employers, employees, or customers - which is against the interests of the company. It's essentially taxation without representation.</div>
<div>Public service nullifies your shareholder obligations &amp; demonstrates your priority is being a public servant. If you're a CEO making this decision, you must have good political machinery in place to manage a large transfer. If you're a shareholder, even more so. This is why union leaders object to government market interference much more than business leaders. Sole proprietors have more freedom &amp; less impact than groups which operate as a collective.</div>
<h2>Social responsibility on a company level harms free society by using justice as an aegis for corporate embezzlement.</h2>

Even Americans think it’s spelled WEETES</div><div><br></div><div>At GM, workers made $29.50/hr, at Fuyao they make $12.80. Workers are grateful to have jobs at all in Dayton, counting themselves blessed. They make enough to live in relatives’ basements, on relatives’ furniture.</div><div><br></div><div>Chinese workers were surprised at how flat Ohio is. Some have left their families in China to work this job. They are required to be away for two years, with no extra pay. They take a special liking to twinkies, guns, Harleys shown to them by American workers.</div><div><br></div><div>Scald marks on hands/forearms are a super common injury.</div><div><br></div><div>Ohio wants to reject the term “rust belt”, resenting being termed as such by both 2020 presidential candidates.</div><div><br></div><div>Fuyao is very careful to discourage unionization from the outset, even in trainings, and admins joke about killing senator Sherrod Brown who advocated for unionization. They ultimately decide never to let this senator’s team on the premises again. Fuyao boss: “if a Union comes in, I’m shutting down. They keep interfering with my production. I’m bleeding money.” He then coerces other board members to enforce this.</div><div><br></div><div>“The same level of efficiency, cost and quality as our competitors.”</div><div><br></div><div>In response to OSHA singling them out for too-dense factory layouts and too-narrow factory walkways: “a tall tree catches the wind.”</div><div><br></div><div>Honcho: “the most important thing is not how much money we earn, but how this will change the Americans’ views of the Chinese and China.

When we try to manage them, they threaten to get help from the union.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>American execs visit Fuyao’s Chinese plant and are astonished to see flawless synchronous paired work, seamless flow of a part between stations, continuous integration along a conveyor belt. Also they are used to constant supervision and required to report constantly. Additionally, they get only one or two days off per month, and work twelve hour shifts. Many have children they rarely see. One woman returns home to see her young child only once a year, at the Spring Festival. Another has a 6-month and two-year old and says he doesn’t get time to take breaks to see them in some years. Some of them are made to pick through piles of broken glass and sort colors for recyclability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One team’s motto: “To stand still is to move back.”</div><div><br></div><div>Chinese workers are all unionized, but the Union leader is also the secretary to the Fuyao communist party committee, and the brother-in-law to the chairman.</div><div><br></div><div>In a display case they have China’s five leaders since it was established: Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zenón, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping. They say the government heavily supports Fuyao, and workers support the company because they are like rowers in a boat: if the boat sinks, everyone loses their jobs.</div><div><br></div><div>They have an insane cross-cultural celebration with extravagant propaganda songs about manufacturing efficiency from a range of kids and teens, plus YMCA dance for American execs, plus a group wedding for employees (complete with wedding ball).</div><div><br></div><div>For the Chinese workers in the Ohio factory, they have televisions on of Chinese children singing and praying all day.</div><div><br></div><div>After American workers protest over 11+ workplace accidents since establishment, Chinese workers are called together for another security briefing about why unionization is disastrous. From January to October the company has lost $40mil. The company fires both its American presidents and hires a new Chinese president, who has spent 27 years in the US and 26 years in China. He cites passion and determination with making him look like he is in his 40s, when in reality he is 53.</div><div><br></div><div>Older American employees adore their Chinese coworkers because most American companies won’t even hire them due to ageism.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than try to find resolution, two employees with differing backgrounds will often try to find blame.</div><div><br></div><div>

<div><b>Cultural sensitivity training 2, later on:</b></div>

We need to use our wisdom to guide them and help them, because we are better than them.”</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Two private table discussions occur:</b></div><div>American complaints about the Chinese:</div><div>They’re in the factory practically 24/7 and use this moral superiority to berate Americans during working hours, while offering very little actual help. They refuse to explain orders when asked why. They refuse to show respect. At least 3000 Americans have come and gone by a year in, after being fired or quitting. All American bosses are demoted. China enforced their control culturally and politically. Their workers poured chemicals into sewers and off of docks at the company.</div><div><br></div><div>Chinese complaints about America:</div><div>Chinese workers lament that you can’t force Americans to work overtime, or even announce overtime at a company level, when in China overtime is mandatory. Some argue Saturdays should be required.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One chinese worker says he is impressed Americans can work two jobs, one at the factory and one outside. He says he always thought Americans lived a comfortable and superior life. He thought they didn’t have to make any sacrifices.</div><div><br></div><div><b>At The union meeting:</b></div><div>An American worker’s daughter who does nails for a living made 40k last year (2017), while the Fuyao worker made 27k. Someone’s coworker was fired for taking a week off because they were hospitalized and didn’t report. Work continued around active fires in the factory. Dayton taxpayers pay tens of millions to Fuyao, but Fuyao has not provided for the community.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One speaker: “We rejected 70 years ago that rich people get to pick and choose what happens to you. Nothing in America has changed in terms of working people working hard. That’s not what changed. What changed his people at the top deciding they want to rewrite the rules to take advantage of people. To make it in their favor at your expense.

u*:|V5T6gg	Basic	Econ / Anthro	Case Interview Secrets	"<div>Case interview secrets</div>
<ul>
<li>Out of 400 Stanford applicants, McKinsey accepted 6, a 1.5% admission rate</li>
<li>Seven parts: process overview, quantitative assessments, real-world fundamentals, problem-solving frameworks, candidate-led interview, other formats, pulling skills together</li>
<li>Seven types of evaluation formats in two categories:</li>
<ul>
<li>Hypothetical-situation case interview</li>
<ul>
<li>Candidate-led case interview:&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>extremely general starting prompt e.g. should we enter XY market; how do we stop losing money</li>
<li>Silence from interviewer for rest of interview</li>
<li>YOU decide what questions to ask</li>
</ul>
<li>Interviewer-led case interview (McKinsey exclusively uses)</li>
<ul>
<li>Interviewer decides what’s important, asks you specific questions</li>
<li>Lots of jumping around in topic, which can be jarring</li>
</ul>
<li>Written case interview</li>
<ul>
<li>Somewhere between 5 and 40 charts, with an hour or two to review all information</li>
<li>Written test administered after this time</li>
</ul>
<li>Group case interview - typically a 4-person group will get several exhibits and an open ended question. You score points by helping colleagues, not sabotage</li>
<li>Presentation-only interview - overlap with written, often paired, lots of exhibits to choose from, pure polish gets you the position</li>
</ul>
<li>Quantitative assessments</li>
<ul>
<li>Many include a mini-case</li>
<li>The quantitative test- McKinsey PST</li>
<ul>
<li>No business knowledge required</li>
<li>Read questions literally and carefully; only answer the question asked, with the data presented</li>
<li>for math - Arithmetic, fractions, percentage calculations</li>
<li>data interpretation - chart analysis &amp; which of four conclusions is NOT supported</li>
<li>numerical critical reasoning - based on the date, which strategy is advantageous?</li>
<li>Take sample tests; practice fundamental skills e.g. math word problems</li>
<li>Find GRE question sets</li>
<li>The above is 70% of the PST, quantitative speed and accuracy, large number estimation</li>
</ul>
<li>The estimation question - use assumptions to solve pen-and-paper math problems</li>
<ul>
<li>Typically, estimate the size of a particular market</li>
<ul>
<li>How many gallons does a gas station pump each week?</li>
<li>How long to relocate an average mountain with an average dump truck?</li>
</ul>
<li>Make a few assumptions where needed, and do the math</li>
<li>Assess HOW you solve problems rather than how accurately</li>
<li>Common format: determine whether an opportunity is worth considering by evaluating whether estimated financial impact is even remotely close to minimum expected financial return. This can eliminate 80% of opportunities</li>
<li>Assess best and worst case scenario customer impact, product price impact, revenue impact</li>
<li>You are hired to end three-year debates between executives in ten minutes of calculation</li>
<ul>
<li>Clients value a consultant’s ability to resolve debates of opinion using estimates based on reasonable assumptions</li>
<li>Consulting firms value people with stellar client service</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill #1: precise arithmetic with large numbers</li>
<ul>
<li>Market size * market share * revenue per buyer</li>
<li>Order of operations: big even numbers first, split complex problems into multiple simple problems, do percentages and fractions last</li>
<li>“A long series of simple math problems rather than a short series of complicated ones”</li>
<li>Arrange before you ever compute</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill 2: rounding numbers intelligently</li>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes quick, directionally correct answers are much better than slow precise ones</li>
<li>Remember whether estimation makes your final answer low or high, and counterweight for that in results and subsequent calculations</li>
<li>Alternate rounding up and rounding down, use physical hand signals to help you remember weighting bias discreetly if needed</li>
<li>Most consultants typically consider +-20% margin of error acceptable on large estimation</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill #3: finding a proxy</li>
<ul>
<li>Substitute product whose market behavior is similar to a product in question</li>
<li>Population size is usually a good proxy for market size, but not always</li>
<li>How many liters of gas does a filling station pump per week?</li>
<ul>
<li>Number of pumps a station has</li>
<li>Number of cars that drive by</li>
<li>Average percentage of pumps in use</li>
<li>Average volume of gas pumped per car</li>
</ul>
<li>It’s 1980 and Motorola has just released a failing product called the cellular phone. As costs and prices decline, what will sales be in 1985?&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Proxy is other young tech markets like fax machines, microwaves, TVs on their first three years</li>
<li>How much did a price drop of 30% affect these technologies once they had broken out of their torturous and expensive first few years?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Skill #4: identifying how your proxy is imperfect</li>
<ul>
<li>Identify if something is closer to an upper limit than a precise estimate</li>
<li>In the gas pump example, know that customers will be highest during rush hours and calculate for those rush hours rather than for 24/7 pumping</li>
<li>Rule out certain proxies based on their correlation to the desired value</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill #5: segment estimates to minimize proxy imperfections</li>
<ul>
<li>Split a vague estimate into multiple precise estimates: the rate at which a gas pump is used should be split into peak, average, and trough hours. The total gallons pumped on a weekday is the sum of these things</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill #6: solving sub-estimates via assumptions, or guesstimating&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Peak hours gallons pumped = # pumps * # % pumps utilized * # cars filled per hour * # gallons per car</li>
<li>Guess that a station has 8 pumps,&nbsp;</li>
<li>Guess 80% in use at peak hours</li>
<li>Guess 6-minutes fill, I.e. a pump can fill ten cars per hour</li>
<li>Guess 10gal gas tanks because many are not completely empty when filled</li>
<li>So find gallons per hour and multiply by number of peak hours</li>
<li>Use peak hours as a proxy for off-peak hours by halving cars present, then multiplying that halved gallons-per-hour by the number of off-peak hours</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Why case interviews exist</li>
<ul>
<li>What a firm does changes yearly &amp; often changes from one interviewer to another</li>
<li>The interview stimulates the job, designed to find good consultants. If you hate the interview, you’ll hate the job</li>
<li>You answer more estimation questions as a consultant than as a candidate</li>
<li>All yourself what you would feel comfortable delivering to a client when your firm’s reputation is on the line</li>
<li>The first stage of proving value is most important for a client, as they try to justify the extra expense for relatively less experienced advisors</li>
<ul>
<li>Ask thought-provoking, insightful, unconsidered questions</li>
<li>Analyze data to discover unforeseen, counterintuitive insights that lead to new decisions</li>
</ul>
<li>Often clients will actively look to discredit you, so avoid the two cardinal sins:</li>
<ul>
<li>Offending a client representative at any level by being rude, arrogant or dismissive</li>
<li>Stating a conclusion you can’t support with data</li>
</ul>
<li>Need analytic interpersonal intelligence</li>
<ul>
<li>Clients interpret nervousness as a lack of conviction in your proposed solution, which is why answering a case perfectly but nervously will get you rejected</li>
<li>You’re often getting graded on how the message is delivered, not the content of the message itself</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>What interviewers look for and why</li>
<ul>
<li>Interviewer look for candidates who seem like colleagues already; act your wage</li>
<li>Sell the interviewer on you; switch the tone from evaluative to collaborative</li>
<li>Consultants and clientele are constantly under tension about who’s screwing who</li>
<li>Team size and constraints are determined by the client, not the consultancy firm</li>
<li>New clients often instill a huge pressure to overdeliver</li>
<li>Each client project has its own profit &amp; loss statement, so each consultant has two billing rates: one hourly/daily rate for the consultants contribution to the client, and one for their cost to the firm, e.g. salary, rent, electricity etc</li>
<ul>
<li>These rates are rarely published, but sent to track whether a client engagement is profitable for the firm</li>
<li>Goal is always high-quality work at low cost &amp; maximum profit</li>
<li>Onboarding for new hires often offsets their value it turns them negative</li>
<li>Firms force engagement teams to take on first-year consultants by waiving that persons “cost” to the team P&amp;L</li>
</ul>
<li>Value of an independent problem-solver&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Extreme tests are often used to gauge new hires’ aptitude for independence and problem-solving</li>
<li>Author was asked to generate $200m new profit in 3-5 years, no other guidance</li>
<li>You need to solve the problem competently and make the firm look good</li>
<li>“Will my current work get easier or harder if you’re on my team?”</li>
<li>Independent problem solvers hiring more of the same</li>
</ul>
<li>“What KEY info is needed to answer the client’s question?”</li>
<ul>
<li>Easy weed out question, ends many interviews</li>
<li>Clients mainly ask yes/no or “what should we do?” Questions, eg</li>
<ul>
<li>Should we merge/close division/enter market segment</li>
<li>There’s XY conflict emerging now. What do we do?</li>
<li>Often selling directional yes/no answers, even with vague questions</li>
</ul>
<li>They often want a fast and simple answer to a complex question, not a complex and precise answer</li>
<ul>
<li>This is why interviewers screen out candidates who can’t get comfortable with being “accurate enough” - “precisely accurate” is a negative</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Often right but never without factual justification</li>
<ul>
<li>Sell confidence in not knowing the right answer, if you have to. Sell confidence in suspecting something true if you have to. Caveat your skepticism and sell confidence in your skepticism.</li>
<li>“I don’t have the facts to be 100% certain”</li>
<li>You speak your firm’s POV; sell it well</li>
<li>A client only hears your firm’s opinion, not yours&nbsp;</li>
<li>The biggest nightmare is that a new hire will embarrass the firm</li>
<li>Interviewers nitpick because clients do</li>
<li>Be prepared to defend every possible situation to substantiate a course of action. You must demonstrate that your advice will ALWAYS hold, no matter what issues the interviewer/client brings up</li>
<li>2 ways to get too often right but never without justification:</li>
<ul>
<li>Gather more factual evidence for your argument</li>
<li>Soften your arguments language to leverage already gathered knowledge</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Being correct diplomatically and client-friendly</li>
<ul>
<li>Clients do not accept factually accurate recommendations, they accept factually supported recommendations they can UNDERSTAND</li>
<li>communication just as important as problem solving</li>
<li>Think and communicate linearly, and draw through lines from A to C at the end of your argument</li>
<li>“The right answer is pointless unless the client can understand the process undertaken to get there.”</li>
<li>Senior clients may not even tell you they’re confused until your proposal gets fully struck down because they want to save face</li>
<li>Communication skills separate the final interview rounds from the job offer</li>
</ul>
<li>The airplane test, or don’t be a dick&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>You’re an outsider by default - sometimes an unwanted, distrusted one. Tough clients hope you will prove them right that you’re terrible</li>
<li>Adapt to your clients’ speed of life and work</li>
<li>Your relationship with your recruiter is your relationship with a client</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Process excellence </b>- when a candidate can consistently follow a problem-solving process. You satisfy both needs:</li>
<ul>
<li>You can follow a structured, analytical process</li>
<li>You can reach the correct conclusions from that process</li>
<li>The first point here is much more important- consistent protocol over correctness in allotted time</li>
<li>Multiple case interviews weed out candidates who get lucky in their accuracy and seeks process-oriented hires</li>
<li>Incomplete answers from excellent processes are permissible; you will eventually ALWAYS get the right answer</li>
<li>Easier to coach someone to solve problems faster than coach them to be more consistently accurate</li>
<li>Interviewer considers what it will be like to manage you</li>
</ul>
<li>CEO-level communication skills</li>
<ul>
<li>Optimize your advice from a high-level executive perspective and don’t waste clients’ time with employee-level details</li>
<li>However, understanding employee-level details is essential to understanding what’s wrong with a company</li>
<li>Integrate micro-recommendations into a big-picture strategy and support those recommendations with factual analysis, instilling confidence in the client</li>
<li>CLARITY and CONFIDENCE make corporate action much more likely, and advice much more valuable</li>
<li>SYNTHESIS is central to recommendation because it provides context: do X because it will have Y effect on Z. Connect the dots and ramifications, and synthesize what will happen if the client follows, or ignores, the recommendations</li>
<li>Synthesis also entails high polish and appropriate detail</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><b>Core problem-solving tools - scientific method/ iterative cycle</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>Hypothesis</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Give instant hypothesis before you start to analyze, then revise that hypothesis as you discover more</li>
<li>If profit is down XY amount, examine profit components ie sales, expenses and costs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Intended to reduce the range of possible conclusions, not widen the variety</li>
<li>Also intended to allow you to reach SOME conclusion with half the time you need to reach THE conclusion</li>
<li>Introduce between 30 seconds and 5 minutes into case work, asking background details as necessary</li>
<li>Never forget your hypothesis in the first portion - two out of three get caught up clarifying. If you absolutely need more than 5 minutes to hypothesize, state that</li>
<li>A late hypothesis WILL get you rejected; an early hypothesis MIGHT</li>
<li><b>The hypothesis is more important than the framework. The case interview is hypothesis-driven, not framework-driven. Critical thinking over formula recall.</b></li>
</ul>
<li><b>Issue tree/logical framework</b></li>
<ul>
<li>A consultant’s substitute for an experiment</li>
<li>Sets out logical conditions with logical sub-conditions under which the conclusion is certainly correct</li>
<li>Interviewers want to see your ENTIRE problem-solving strategy to front. Cover your main branches, and then begin drill down to structure the logic of each branch</li>
<li>For the common issue of declining profits, the profitability framework divides into two trees:</li>
<ul>
<li>Profit = sales revenue - operating costs</li>
<ul>
<li>Revenue = Price per unit * units sold</li>
<li>Cost = units sold * cost/unit</li>
<ul>
<li>Cost/unit = fixed c/u + variable c/u</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Every issue has an incentive/benefit framework for all involved parties</li>
<li>Weak/strong problem structuring grades are essential to the offer</li>
<ul>
<li>State issue tree early and logically</li>
<li>Don’t omit key conditions</li>
</ul>
<li><b>VALIDITY TESTING</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>Top 2 interviewer complaints:</b> mechanical formula-based approaches lacking critical thinking; lacking a hypothesis</li>
<li><b>Hypothesis</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Issue tree formation requires, and is predicated on, hypothesi<b>s</b></li>
</ul>
<li><b>McKinsey MECE test</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive</li>
<li>Categorizes decision-making factors and grades your ability to group information into discrete mutually exclusive categories which cover all possible options (collectively exhaustive)</li>
<li>Discrete categories with no overlap between, which together cover all possible factors</li>
<li>E.g. profits = revenue-cost</li>
<ul>
<li>Cost = fixed cost + total variable cost</li>
<li>TVC = cost/unit * # units manufactured</li>
</ul>
<li>For profit to increase, cost must decrease our revenue must increase. Nothing is overlapped, nothing is left out, all things are presented in categories. MECE approved</li>
<li>Financial vs non-financial factors also work</li>
<li>Internal vs external factors also work</li>
<li>Hypothesis: introducing xyz product makes sense.</li>
<ul>
<li>Favorable customer factors</li>
<li>Favorable competitive environment</li>
<li>Favorable company operations factors</li>

<li><b>Victor Cheng “conclusiveness” test</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Ensure using an issue tree that if all branches turn out to be true, the hypothesis must be true</li>
<li>Every branch must be factually backed and factually fallible; each branch must itself have high conclusiveness</li>
<li>Hypothesis: Apple should introduce the iPad.</li>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li> <b>Drill-down analysis</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Create logical dead ends either by proving or disproving branches of the tree, and showing those argument elements valid or invalid</li>
<li>You are spending 75% of time on PROBLEM ISOLATION AND DEFINITION, and 25% on PROBLEM SOLVING</li>
<ul>
<li>Never propose a solution until you’ve isolated/defined problem</li>
<li>The solution is just a formality if you’ve defined correctly</li>
<li>If you reach the end of the case without an obvious answer:</li>
<ul>
<li>You set up an incorrect issue tree.</li>
<li>You missed the full depth of a branch or eliminated incorrectly.</li>
<li>The interviewer gave you a key piece of info which you glossed over without analysis, and missed the ability to eliminate a branch.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Process of logical elimination by order of relevance, validity, and soundness under the hypothesis</li>
<li>Revise hypothesis instantly if you discover inconsistency; this is why this stage exists.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>State EVERYTHING aloud in your thought process: “</b>My hypothesis is that the profitability issue is caused by a revenue decline, not a cost increase. I’d like to start by analyzing the revenue side and circle back to the cost side if necessary”.<b> </b>“Hmm, this new evidence casts some doubt on my original hypothesis.”</li>
<li>Not stating logical conflicts = Not understanding conflicts in the interviewers eyes&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Start with the most uncertain branch, or the most central to your hypothesis which could most easily prove/disprove it.</b></li>
<li><b>Use a 70-30 ratio of quantitative-to-qualitative analysis.</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Quantify EVERY branch by asking for pricing, unit sales, cost data going back several years. Ask for competitor data as well. Verify any qualitative claims made.</li>
<li>If costs have increased AND revenue has declined, measure percentage of profit decline attributable to each. You may uncover a 75-25 split between revenue and cost issues.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Quantitative helps answer WHAT is causing a business symptom and by HOW MUCH.</li>
<li>qualitative helps determine WHY a certain decision was made by a client, and HOW process decisions are made.</li>
<li>YOU’RE ALLOWED TO ASK BASIC WHY QUESTIONS</li>
<ul>
<li>What percentage of profit decline came from a drop in sales?</li>
<li>Why have transportation costs gone up for the client but not for the rest of the industry? How is the transportation process different for the client, and why?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><b>Don’t stop branch analysis until you reach a sub-conclusion</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Stopping point determined by 70% hard data and 30% judgement.</li>
<li>Find the minimally necessary data to support hypothesis</li>
<ul>
<li>No need to know whether a market segment is shrinking by 5% yearly or 20% yearly</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Use diagrams to take notes</li>
<ul>
<li>Don’t list, mind map instead. Two different sets of paper:</li>
<li>one focuses on case structure &amp; should be kept ultra neat. Exclusively tree diagrams and hypotheses. Even if you’re interrupted, this is your road map for you/interviewer to determine where you are.</li>
<ul>
<li>Graphically eliminate or verify branches here for the interviewer. One branch will visually remain at the end: The root of the problem.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>Two is a scratch pad and notes. Use this to determine whether you can eliminate a branch mathematically. This way, calculations can take pages but the roadmap will remain static. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Visible issue is often a symptom of an underlying problem, but you can’t just tell clients they’re wrong. You need severe justification beyond reasonable doubt.</li>
<li>Don’t just tell the answer; lead your listener to it logically</li>

<ul>
<li>If after assessment the market is wavering, eliminate this branch.</li>
</ul>
<li>Client has a strong &amp; sustainable competitive advantage in XYZ market.</li>
<ul>
<li>Understand four key areas here:&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Customers(Who? Where? What demand? What do competitors know?)</li>
<li>Products (What offerings? How do they compete?)</li>
<li>Clients (What’s unique or unusual compared to competitors?)</li>
<li>Competition (Do competitors differentiate and how?)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Competition in the market is modest &amp; can be beaten with modest effort</li>
<li>If a branch proves correct and consistent, continue. If not, reassess tree and hypothesis wholesale. If needed, narrow the hypothesis: “Client should enter the ABC (growing) segment of the XYZ market.”</li>
<ul>
<li>No single branch of the tree could lead you to this conclusion; you must factor multiple lines of logic</li>
<li>One market segment is growing and attractive.</li>
<ul>
<li>easy to prove/disprove with data</li>
</ul>
<li>Client has at least a modest competitive advantage here which has strengthened and will continue</li>
<ul>
<li>Tough to prove/disprove - Why is the segment growing? Is growth driven by certain customers/regions/product categories?&nbsp;</li>

yBj;ItBKR$	Basic	Econ / Anthro	Modeling	"<div>The most common question on here seems to be how to get started so here's a post about everything you need to know, sorry if I missed anything.</div>
<div><b>How do I get an agency/how do I get scouted?</b></div>
<div>There are many ways to get scouted, it could be on the street or it could be by using an agencies social media scouting tags. For example, IMG scouts on social media using the hashtag (#WLYG &amp; #weloveyourgenes) you can also tag the accounts @/weloveyourgenes &amp; @/imgmodels on the posts.</div>
<div>Many agencies have this method of scouting online and you can go to their website to see if they offer it. If you get scouted this way make sure it is by the verified accounts, if you're unsure if it's a trusted account get in contact with the main page to ask. In most cases the agency will ask to see more photos/videos of you then ask for a zoom meeting (or in person if you are in the city you're applying to) the offer a contract if they like you. Don't be afraid to ask questions and have someone look over it for you before signing.</div>
<div>The most common method would be to apply to an agency through there website. You don't need professional photos for this, just follow the guidelines on the website and take them on a phone or digital camera. Do not wear makeup and pick an outfit that shows your figure. Skinny jeans and a tank top is always a good choice.</div>
<div>Finding a trust worthy agency is key. I recommend looking on models.com to find a reliable agency. They have agencies ranked from premium to basic, as well as what country/city they are located in. Many agencies take models from all over so don't be scared to apply if you do not live in the same place you are applying to. If there are no agencies near you, there is always the option to apply to a small boutique agency near you.</div>
<div><a href=""https://models.com/agencies/modeling/All/All"">https://models.com/agencies/modeling/All/All</a></div>
<div><b>What's a mother agency</b></div>
<div>A mother agency generally refers to the first agency you sign with. The goal of mother agencies is to help you develop as a model. They usually help get you scouted in different markets or bigger agencies. However, it all depends on your contract. If you have an exclusive contract with your mother agency you are usually not allowed to sign with other agencies in different markets. If you have a non-exclusive contract you are free to sign with other agencies on your own.</div>
<div><b>What do I pay to an agency</b></div>
<div>A trustworthy agency will never make you pay anything upfront, and many that do ask you to pay are scams. However, most agencies do take a commission fee out of your jobs, this can be anywhere from 0-30% (20% is most common). A lot of agencies do charge for website fees but this is usually under $100. Things such as hotels, flights, and model apartments also come from your paycheck. Comp cards are usually $1 and there are digital versions you can present. Test shoots can be free or they can cost money, it depends on who you're photographer is and your agent should always check with you beforehand if it's ok to spend money. Paychecks are not upfront and tend to be given months after a job; most agencies offer cash advances but this usually has a small interest rate.</div>
<div><b>Commercial vs High Fashion modeling</b></div>
<div>Anyone can be a commercial model, there are no standards. The work included in this type of modeling includes ecommerce, catalogues, tv ads, fit modeling, etc. It does not included runway work and editorials are rare. However, commercial modeling tends to pay much better than high fashion work.</div>
<div>High fashion modeling includes editorials, runway, etc. High fashion has very strict standards; models are expected to be 5'9+ and have measurements no larger than 36-25-36. The pay for high fashion modeling is usually not very high and a lot of work gets paid through exposure.</div>
<div><b>Model Apartments</b></div>
<div>Model apartments are what they sound like. Apartments with multiple models living in them at a time. Most model apartments have bunk beds for all the models living there. They are not free and usually cost anywhere from $20-$70 a night. Generally this comes from your paycheck and model apartments tend to get a lot of models in debt to their agency. If possible try to find an apartment and room with other models, it is cheaper and cleaner that way.</div>
<div><b>Social Media</b></div>
<div>You do not need social media to become a model but it is looked at by both agencies and clients. A agency may sign a model with more followers and a client may pick a model with a higher amount of followers. Your social media should generally have at least some of the work you've done on there.</div>
<div><b>Casting Calls</b></div>
<div>This is basically an ""audition"", bring your comp card and show up early. Wear little to no makeup and once again skinny jeans and a tank is a good outfit.</div>
<div><b>Do I have what it takes?</b></div>
<div>It all depends on the agency and what they are looking for. An agency may pass on you while another may love your look. Focus on getting an agency that truly believes in you over a big agency.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Some good headshots, professional look, athletic and casual looks are usually a necessity.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This is very true. I was shocked to read somewhere that getting in a mag like Vogue, you could only be paid a few hundred if that. It’s a nepotism/wealthy kids playground but if passionate can be fun. Beauty/commercial does pay better and way funnier shoots too.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Chances are your 9-5 will always make more than modeling plus you get very good benefits. Save at least two years of rent and a bit more. You have to pay for EVERYTHING it's not glamorous. Clients will sometimes pay for hotels and flights but that is rare, usually you pay out of future paychecks. There's also website fees you need to pay. Pay is inconsistent and you can be getting payment for a job months later and jobs aren't consistent. Even when you do get paid the amount is always lower due to commissions and fees that go to your agency. My agency offers cash advances with fees.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If you're going to be staying in a model apartment you need to pay for that too. You'll likely be in debt to your agency when starting out. One of the model apartments I was in was $90 a day (roughly $2700 monthly) with each room having 2/3 bunk beds with strict rules. Agencies pay a small fee of like $5000 monthly for the apartment and with multiple girls living there at the same time they are making huge profits. It is not free to stay there, agencies will take your paychecks to pay for the apartments</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Rates can vary and are never based on how much actual work you do. Editorials/Runway rates are bad and commercial/beauty generally pays better. There are also a lot of shoots you get paid nothing in order to build your portfolio or offers where you get paid in exposure</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Modeling is not something you do for money, if you want good money get into influencing and hope you get lucky. Modeling is something you have to put 100% in and even that does not guarantee you'll be successful</div>
<div>Modeling will always be a side job unless you get huge. Best way to do it as a side job though is not to be signed with an agency as they will have you going to castings randomly throughout the week and random times. So it'll be hard to have your primary job and be signed. Freelancing is your best bet. I am signed in NYC and I quickly realized it was nearly impossible to call off for my 9-5 as I could never anticipate when my agent would put me to work.</div>
<div>On that note, check out some modeling apps. I recommend Newbook and Swipecast as I use those primarily whenever I'm not doing agency castings. Obviously they cater a lot towards LA/NYC but you never know.</div>"	behavior career

Gladwell posits that success is a complex concoction of opportunities, cultural legacy, and the time we are born into. He challenges the conventional wisdom that success is solely a result of personal effort, instead highlighting the importance of external factors that contribute to an individual's ability to succeed.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Movement 1: The Role of Opportunity and Timing:</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>Gladwell introduces the concept of the ""Matthew Effect,"" where he discusses how small advantages can accumulate over time, leading to significant disparities in success. He illustrates this with the ""10,000-Hour Rule,"" suggesting that true expertise in any skill is the result of approximately 10,000 hours of practice, an opportunity that not everyone can access. This rule is exemplified by the Beatles, who performed lengthy gigs in Hamburg, and Bill Gates, who had unique access to a computer at a time when such access was rare.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Movement 2: The Trouble with Geniuses:</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>In his examination of intelligence, Gladwell presents the ""Trouble with Geniuses,"" where he argues that beyond a certain IQ threshold, the predictive value of intelligence on success is limited. He discusses the stories of Christopher Langan and Robert Oppenheimer, showing that social savvy and practical intelligence are just as important as raw intellect, if not more so.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Movement 3: Cultural Legacy:</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>Gladwell explores the ""Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes,"" where he attributes differing cultural legacies of communication to the safety records of various airlines. He also discusses how cultural legacies affect achievement in education, as seen in the rigorous work ethic derived from the cultural traditions of rice farming in Asian countries.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Conclusion:</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>Gladwell's ""Outliers"" is a compelling narrative that shifts the focus from individual attributes to a broader sociocultural context. It underscores the importance of acknowledging the external factors that contribute to success, such as the time and place of one's birth, cultural legacies, and access to opportunities. By understanding these factors, we can better appreciate the complexities behind success and the potential for cultivating it in others.</div><h3>10 Important Case Studies/Examples</h3><ol><li><div><strong>The Roseto Mystery:</strong> A small town in Pennsylvania with a remarkably low rate of heart disease, which Gladwell attributes to the close-knit community and social support, rather than diet or genetics. (Pages 10-17)</div></li><li><div><strong>The 10,000-Hour Rule:</strong> The Beatles and Bill Gates serve as examples of how extensive practice time leads to mastery in their fields. The Beatles played long hours in Hamburg, while Gates had unique access to a computer during adolescence.

(Pages 6)</div></li><li><div><strong>The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 1 &amp; 2:</strong> The contrasting stories of Christopher Langan, a man with a high IQ who struggled with practical aspects of success, and Robert Oppenheimer, who despite setbacks, used his practical intelligence to achieve prominence.

He}=q{b$vn	Basic	Econ / Anthro	How to Grow Your Career in AI - Andrew Ng handbook for Fourthbrain.ai	"**5-Paragraph Summary**<br><br>**Introduction:**<br>Andrew Ng's guide to career growth in AI emphasizes the transformative power of AI, likening coding for AI to a new form of literacy. He draws parallels between historical literacy and the current trajectory of AI, suggesting that just as reading and writing became fundamental skills for societal advancement, so too will the ability to code and work with AI (Page 4).<br><br>**First Major Movement:**<br>Ng outlines a three-step framework for career growth in AI: learning foundational skills, working on projects, and finding a job. He stresses that learning is a lifelong process, especially in a rapidly evolving field like AI. Foundational skills include understanding machine learning models and core concepts, deep learning, relevant mathematics, and software development. Ng advises that organized courses are often the most efficient way to master these skills (Pages 5-10).<br><br>**Second Major Movement:**<br>The author discusses the importance of scoping successful AI projects. He provides a five-step process for identifying and developing AI solutions to real-world problems. This involves understanding business problems, brainstorming AI solutions, assessing feasibility and value, determining milestones, and budgeting for resources. Ng emphasizes the iterative nature of this process and encourages seeking impactful projects even without deep domain expertise (Pages 14-16).<br><br>**Third Major Movement:**<br>Ng touches on the role of math in AI, suggesting that while a deep understanding of mathematics can be beneficial, especially for debugging and optimizing algorithms, the necessity varies with the maturity of the technology. He encourages learning driven by curiosity and the pursuit of continuous learning to stay abreast of the rapidly changing field (Pages 12-13).<br><br>**Conclusion:**<br>In conclusion, Ng's book provides a comprehensive roadmap for individuals looking to grow their careers in AI. The focus is on continuous learning, practical project experience, and the strategic application of AI to solve meaningful problems. He advocates for a balanced approach to learning technical skills, understanding the math behind AI, and the importance of community and collaboration in this journey (Pages 1-17).<br><br>**10 Bullet Points Highlighting Important Case Studies/Examples:**<br><br>1. **AI as the New Electricity:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ng compares AI's potential impact to that of electricity, suggesting it will permeate and enhance all aspects of human life (Page 2).<br><br>2. **The Pizza Parlor Example:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - A practical illustration of how AI can be applied in everyday life, such as a pizza maker using linear regression to optimize supply chain and staffing (Page 4).<br><br>3. **Career Framework Application:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ng's framework is applied to AI, with unique challenges such as the need for continuous learning due to the nascent nature of AI technologies (Pages 6-7).<br><br>4. **Importance of Foundational Skills:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Emphasizes the necessity of understanding machine learning models, deep learning, and the relevant math and software development skills (Pages 8-9).<br><br>5. **Learning as a Habit:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Recommends starting small to build the habit of continuous learning, drawing from BJ Fogg's ""Tiny Habits"" methodology (Page 11).<br><br>6. **Math in AI:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Discusses the varying importance of math in AI roles, with an emphasis on understanding algorithms for better decision-making (Page 13).<br><br>7. **Scoping AI Projects:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Provides a step-by-step approach to identifying and developing AI projects that can have a real-world impact (Pages 14-16).<br><br>8. **Iterative Project Development:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Highlights the iterative nature of AI project development, where one must be willing to revisit and revise steps based on new insights (Page 16).<br><br>9. **Educational Approach:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Advocates for structured learning through courses for a coherent understanding over disjointed internet resources (Page 10).<br><br>10. **The Role of Community:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Stresses the importance of building a supportive community for help and collaboration throughout one's AI career journey (Page 7).<br><br>**5 Bottom-Line Pieces of Actionable Advice:**<br><br>1. **Embrace Lifelong Learning:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Successful AI professionals engage in continuous learning to keep up with the evolving field.<br><br>2. **Prioritize Practical Experience:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Hands-on projects are crucial for deepening skills and building a portfolio that demonstrates skill progression.<br><br>3. **Understand Business Implications:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - AI professionals should focus on identifying business problems that AI can solve, not just AI problems in isolation.<br><br>4. **Cultivate Coding Literacy:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Coding, especially in AI-related technologies, is becoming as essential as traditional literacy once was.<br><br>5. **Build a Supportive Network:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - A community of peers and mentors is invaluable for support, learning, and navigating the AI career landscape.<br><br>We finished processing the whole document with the PDF Search plugin.
