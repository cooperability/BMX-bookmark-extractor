<u>Transduction</u>: transformation of light
energy to electrical signals</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Photoreceptors transform light
energy (photons) to electrical signals. There are two types of photoreceptors
(rods and cones) which both absorb photons and generate an electrical
potential. Thus, both rods and cones perform transduction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt=""A picture containing circuit

Description automatically generated"" src=""clip_image001.png""><u>Dark adaptation</u>: The time it takes
photoreceptors to reach their maximal sensitivity in low light conditions</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although
rods and cones both perform transduction, their sensitivity to the light is
different. As you can see from the figure on the right, rods have much lower
threshold than the cones. This suggests that rods are more sensitive than
cones, as transduction in rods occurs at lower light intensities than in cones.
Therefore, night vision is based on rods. However, as you might have noticed
from the ‘time in the dark (min)’, it takes rods longer time than cones to
reach maximal sensitivity. To be specific, for cones it takes about 8 mins to
reach the maximal sensitivity while, it takes about 20 mins for rods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Wavelength encoding</u>: Different
photoreceptors have pigments that absorb light at different wavelengths,
forming the basis for color vision </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All rods have the same
photopigment (rhodopsin) while, cones have 3 kinds of photopigments, which
respond to long, medium, and short wavelengths. As we can see from the figure
below, each photoreceptor observes a range of wavelengths, not a single wavelength.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;<u>Data
compression: </u>why we see blurry in the periphery. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Spatial distribution of photoreceptors
is not uniform across the retina. We have more cones in the fovea than
periphery. In contrast, we have more rods in the periphery (their density peaks
at round 20 deg) and have almost no rods in the fovea. Therefore, fovea is
dominated by the signals from the cones and periphery is dominated by the
signals of the rods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Many-to-one relationship is found
in the periphery. Inputs from as many as 50 photoreceptors converge to a single
ganglion cell. &nbsp;Pooling information from
multiple photoreceptors increases visual sensitivity (ability to detect/perceive
light), which makes rod system to function well in dim light conditions.
However, as the information is coming from multiple photoreceptors, the peripheral
vision has low visual acuity (the finest detail that can be resolved by the
eyes).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Whereas, in the fovea, cones tend
to have one-to-one relationship with the ganglion cells. This one-to-one
relationship results in increase in visual acuity and decrease in sensitivity
to light. This is why we see clear images in the fovea and blurry images in the
periphery.</div>

uIq7o0UE8r	Basic	Psych / Socio	Place Coding vs Temporal Coding	"Place coding in Cochlea vs time coding in auditory nerve<br><br>The nature of pitch and its neural coding have been studied for over a 
century. A popular debate has revolved around the question of whether 
pitch is coded via “place” cues in the cochlea, or via timing cues in 
the auditory nerve. In the most recent incarnation of this debate, the 
role of temporal fine structure has been emphasized in conveying 
important pitch and speech information, particularly because the lack of
 temporal fine structure coding in cochlear implants might explain some 
of the difficulties faced by cochlear implant users in perceiving music 
and pitch contours in speech. In addition, some studies have postulated 
that hearing-impaired listeners may have a specific deficit related to 
processing temporal fine structure. This article reviews some of the 
recent literature surrounding the debate, and argues that much of the 
recent evidence suggesting the importance of temporal fine structure 
processing can also be accounted for using spectral (place) or 
temporal-envelope cues."	perception
M%qxY.aq@W	Basic	Psych / Socio	Fundamental Frequency &amp; Harmonics	"what we hear as
          a single sound or pitch when someone is speaking (for example,
          when making the sound [i]) is really a <i>fundamental
            frequency </i>基頻 (determined by how many times the vocal
          folds vibrate in one second, and measured in cycles per second
          [cps], or hertz 赫 [Hz]; named after the German physicist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz"">Heinrich Rudolf Hertz</a>), plus a whole
          series of <i>harmonics</i> 諧音 (often called 泛音 on stringed instruments)
            or <i>overtones</i> 倍音. These


          terms overlap in meaning, but: ""harmonic"" includes the
          fundamental frequency and all of the overtones above it, while
          ""overtones"" include all frequencies <b>greater </b><b>than</b>
          the fundamental frequency. <br>
<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The harmonics are <i>multiples of
            the fundamental frequency</i>. So if the fundamental
          frequency is 100 Hz, the higher harmonics will be 200 Hz, 300
          Hz, 400 Hz, 500 Hz, and so on. If the fundamental frequency
          were 220 Hz, the harmonics would be 440 Hz, 660 Hz, 880 Hz,
          and so on. In terms of intervals on the scale, we hear a base
          tone, its octave (eight notes up), then a note that is a
          twelfth up, i.e. a perfect fifth above the octave above the
          starting pitch, then a note two octaves up from the starting
          pitch, then one that is a major third above that, and on and
          on.<br><br>&nbsp;We normally don't hear the harmonics as
          separate tones, first of all because they have an increasingly
          lower amplitude than the fundamental frequency the higher up

 wearing of face masks can be the result of a prosocial emotional 
process—empathy for people most vulnerable to the virus. In four 
preregistered studies (<i>N</i> = 3,718, Western population), we found 
that (a) empathy indeed relates to the motivation to adhere to physical 
distancing and to wearing face masks and (b) inducing empathy for people
 most vulnerable to the virus promotes the motivation to adhere to these
 measures (whereas merely providing information about the importance of 
the measures does not). In sum, the present research provides a better 
understanding of the factors underlying the willingness to follow two 
important measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br></div>"

of the left visual field (1) and only the right eye
has access to the far periphery of the right
visual field</div><div><br></div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>At the optic chiasm, the optic
nerve carrying these representations of the
visual field partially crosses, such that the
entire left visual field is routed to the right
hemisphere of the brain and the right visual
field is routed to the left hemisphere of the

</div>
</div></div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>The visual
representations continue to the lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN), where they first
synapse and then continue along the optic
radiation to cortex. There, we find the second
synapse at primary visual cortex (also referred
to as V1, striate cortex or area 17).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Visual areas are arranged in (at least) two processing streams emerging from early
visual areas (V1, V2 and V3). One stream, referred to as the <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">dorsal stream</span>, ascends dorsally
from early visual cortex to areas along the parietal lobe. The second, <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">ventral stream</span>, on the
other hand, continues from early visual areas to the ventral aspect of the temporal lobe. These
two pathways are thought to serve different functions.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<b>Ungerleidger and Mishkin’s famous 1982 experiment. -&nbsp;</b>lesions to dorsal &amp; ventral stream with associated disruptions to ""where"" &amp; ""what"" tasks, respectively. These two pathways have been dubbed the “what” (ventral) and “where” (dorsal)
pathways (Ungerleider &amp; Mishkin, 1982).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>They found that lesions in parietal cortex produced deficits in the “where” task but not
the “what” task, while lesions in temporal cortex produced deficits in the “what” task but not the
“where” task. These results indicated a <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">double dissociation </span>of function across the dorsal and
ventral pathways. A double dissociation is evident if one manipulation affects the first variable
and not the second, while the other manipulation affects the second variable and not the first. In
our case, a lesion to the parietal lobe affects spatial perception but not recognition, while a
lesion to the temporal lobe affects recognition but not spatial perception.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>In humans, damage to end stages of the ventral stream can cause deficits in object
recognition called <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">visual agnosias</span>. A visual agnosia is defined as an impairment in object
recognition that can’t be attributed to a general loss in intelligence or elementary visual
perceptual losses such as in brightness, acuity, depth or color. Check out the patient video in
module 5 (“NOVA-stranger in the mirror”) for an example. Damage to end stages of the dorsal
stream, on the other hand, produces deficits in spatial perception and grasping. One example is
unilateral neglect, an impairment of spatial vision in which patients fail to notice things in the
visual field opposite (contralateral) to their damaged or lesioned hemisphere (check out
“neglect.mov” for an example patient). These disorders are consistent with Ungerleider and
Mishkin’s conceptualization of the ventral stream as a “what” pathway and the dorsal stream as
a “where” pathway.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>However, based on a patient with a different lesion and disorder, Goodale and Milner
(1992) proposed a different function for the dorsal stream. Specifically, they proposed that the
dorsal stream is instead best characterized as a “how” processing stream, which is involved in
visually guided actions. Goodale and Milner also devised two tasks - a perceptual matching
task, in which the participant was instructed to indicate the orientation of card (e.g.
vertical/horizontal) and a second, visuomotor posting task, in which the participant was
instructed to rotate a card so they could post it though an oriented slot. They found that a
patient, “DF”, with a lesion to the ventral stream, failed the perceptual task, suggesting that she
did not have visual form perception, as predicted by Ungerleider and Mishkin’s theory. However,
DF surprisingly still performed well at the visuomotor posting task. A second patient, “RV”, on
the other hand, had a lesion to their dorsal stream and despite being able to perform well on the
perceptual matching task, failed the visuomotor posting task. This inability to use visual
information to reach out and grasp objects, while at the same time having no difficulty in
recognizing or describing objects in the impaired visual field is called <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">object ataxia</span>. An example
video can be seen here.
</div>
<div>Thus, Goodale and Milner also provide evidence for a double dissociation between the
ventral and dorsal streams. However, they propose a different role for the dorsal stream:
involvement in visually guided action. This is in contrast to Ungerleider and Mishkin’s proposed
role for the dorsal stream: spatial localization. The role of different visual processing streams, as
well as how many there are in the human brain, is still an active topic of research even today.&nbsp;</div>

Improved mood reduces anxiety, which improves focus and planning. Focus and planning help with decision making. Decision making further reduces anxiety and improves enjoyment.

tMu!%I&Rtc	Basic	Psych / Socio	Conversational Psychology	I’m someone who has to actively listen to people for a living (and married to someone who feels compelled to frequently interrupt me for periodic, verbal affirmations).<br><br>Body language can be your best (and least disruptive) friend. Try the following things and I’m confident your friends/family/colleagues will feel you’re engaged (albeit silent).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At its most basic level, look at the person. In particular, if you slightly cock your head to the side when they’re talking, it’s one of my favorite ways of demonstrating interest and/or curiosity (if you don’t know what this looks like, picture a curious puppy who is listening to their human speak). Then, occasionally punctuate the head tilt with a few small nods (when they say something of particular note).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you’re able to take notes while someone talks (e.g. it’s a work meeting or you’re on a phone call), that can often help tie up your brain (in a good way) while they talk. It’s also another non-disruptive way of showing interest. In contrast, if I’m sharing a ton of information with someone (particularly in a professional setting) and they’re not taking notes, I’m highly skeptical of their ability (and intent) to remember anything I’m saying.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaning forward (e.g. in a chair) can also be a good non-verbal indication of being engaged, whereas leaning backwards (away from the speaker) can indicate the opposite.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you start looking at your watch/phone or over their shoulder, people notice. This can actually be helpful when you want to get OUT of a conversation. Similarly, be mindful of any other body language (mannerisms) that can demonstrate impatience. For example, some people start to bounce their leg or fidget.<br><br>If you’re able to patiently wait for the person to complete their thoughts, here are some verbal responses I use all the time, which demonstrate I’m engaged and actively listening:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let me see if I’m understanding correctly… &lt;restate what they said in your own words&gt;” Funny enough, even if you restate 100% accurately, it often makes the other person want to talk more (expound upon things or provide more detail). Use at your own risk. :)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Could you tell me more about… &lt;something they said&gt;?” I love this one because I can guide the conversation towards something in the conversation that I’m interested in, while simultaneously showing that I’m actively listening.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Thank you for sharing that.” Very simple and nothing fancy, but it’s effective. Expressing some sign of gratitude for someone’s contribution to the conversation is a good way to make their contributions feel valued, especially if you have nothing further to say/ask. As an optional (but powerful) bonus, you can add in a quick note about how something they said has meaning to you (e.g. you can relate to it, it taught you something, etc.). Likewise, expressing gratitude can be a great time to end the conversation or transition the conversation to something else.	behavior expression sociology

oIH{:[/w$f	Basic	Psych / Socio	The Brain Doesn't Work the Way You Think it Does - Quanta Magazine	"""But memory, for example, also requires brain networks other than the 
hippocampus, and the hippocampus is turning out to be key to a growing 
number of cognitive processes other than memory.""<br><br>""This identity crisis isn’t limited to neural centers of perception or 
other cognitive functions. The cerebellum, a structure in the brains of 
all vertebrates, was thought to be dedicated almost exclusively to motor
 control, but scientists have found that it’s also instrumental in 
attention processes, the regulation of emotions, language processing and
 decision-making. The basal ganglia, another ancient part of the brain 
usually associated with motor control, has been similarly implicated in 
several high-level cognitive processes.""<br><div>“You think that your results are telling you something about high-level cognition,” said <a href=""https://buzsakilab.com/wp/buzsaki/"">György Buzsáki</a>,
 a neuroscientist at the NYU School of Medicine, “when in fact, it may 
reflect nothing else except that, because of the task, [the subject’s] 
eyes are moving differently.”</div>
<div>But he and other scientists believe the recent findings also 
highlight a deeper conceptual problem in neuroscience. “We divide the 
real estate of the brain according to our preconceived ideas, assuming —
 wrongly, as far as I’m concerned — that those preconceived ideas have 
boundaries, and the same boundaries exist in brain function,” Buzsáki 
said.</div><div><br></div><div><div>Research shows that the feeling of fear arises in the prefrontal cortex and related brain areas.</div>
<div>The amygdala, on the other hand, is involved with processing and 
responding to threats — an ancient, subconscious behavioral and 
physiological mechanism. “The evidence shows that it’s not always fear 
that causes the behavior,” LeDoux said.</div></div><br>Cisek has already used his new breakdown of brain activities to explain 
why, for instance, the basal ganglia plays a key role in some 
decision-making tasks but not others. “You realize that neither the term
 ‘decision-making’ nor the term ‘attention’ actually corresponds to a 
thing in the brain,” he said. “Instead, there are certain very pragmatic
 circuits in the brain, and they do certain things like ‘approach’ or 
‘avoid.’ … Some of those things are going to look a bit like attention.”<br><a href=""https://www.quantamagazine.org/mental-phenomena-dont-map-into-the-brain-as-expected-20210824/?utm_source=Stanford+Report&amp;utm_campaign=95f48171e1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_25_03_17&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_29ce9f751e-95f48171e1-53322833"">https://www.quantamagazine.org/mental-phenomena-dont-map-into-the-brain-as-expected-20210824/?utm_source=Stanford+Report&amp;utm_campaign=95f48171e1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_25_03_17&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_29ce9f751e-95f48171e1-53322833</a><br>"	history neurobiology neurotopology perception psychology

<li>Survey of lessons from people married for 10+ years and are still happy
-Happiness doesn't necessarily lie in achieving your dreams or some pleasurable high, but rather in finding the struggles you enjoy

-Not because you're pressured or because youre lonely or because you think it will solve anything or because you think it will make you look good

-as with anything, there will be bad patches
-the love you share will always be changing
-romantic love is infatuation is an evolutionary instinct that will only last a few years</li>
<li>most important factor in a relationship is not communication, but respect

Focus on why and you will find your hire - keep with it
Notice and note your own reactions and be honest with yourself
It’s okay to feel the way you feel
Physical health is intertwined with mental health</div>
<div>Address your CIRCUMSTANCES before your SYMPTOMS</div>
<div>Brain traffic management, or lack thereof usually causes the majority of mental health issues</div>
<ul>
<li>pre frontal cortex executive function, problem solving, goal setting, social interactions
-most recent human brain evolution, primarily to distinguish us from primates.
-takes longest to grow of any brain part
-ventral PFC, back of PFC, hostess emotion</li>
</ul>
<div>PFC has its information vetted by the ACC, which registers communication between the thinking brain and the feeling brain</div>
<div>Spindle neurons are long anD send signals much faster than other neurons
Scientists think feeling and thinking more are part of evolution to higher cognition</div>
<div>If the pre frontal cortex does the thinking, the limbic system(amygdala &amp; hippocampus) does the feeling
Limbic system enshrines trauma &amp; stores memories
Amygdala’s job is to relate memories to emotions, to manage episodic autobiographical memories (eam) - evidence-based knowledge</div>
<div>Memories are stored as stories with emotions attached</div>
<div>Fight, flight or freeze- it’s the brain stem
First part of brain to evolve
Controls rate, speed, intensity of respiratory-circulatory, can get anxiety or panic attacks</div>
<div>Storytelling is the default mode of our brains, but can be visceral over objectivity, can finger more than facts
PFC holds seven pieces of information, plus or minus two</div>
<div>The amygdala often wrests control from the PFC
Stimulus discrimination allows us to rationally sift through stimulus data, occurs constantly in the PFC and is disrupted by amygdala activity</div>
<div>#PTSD
In that ptsd is failure to recover from trauma, we can’t diagnose it within the first month after a trauma incident - we don’t yet know whether we’ll recover or not</div>
<div>#emotions
Emotions are evolutionarily meant to last no longer than 90 seconds, so that they don’t impede decision making
Rumination and avoidance are our brain’s way of creating a sense of control in uncontrollable situations
Feels safer than examining a situation and letting it go
Not much difference with healing methods over time, but the rapidness with which you address the trauma matters a ton
Set aside time to face your anxieties, whether through writing or meditation, but force yourself to confront them</div>"	book depression health isolation psychology selfhelp sociology

The best way to take in the world is to be fascinated by, and grateful for, every shred of learning you can gain.</li>
<li>

The great purpose of an education is orientation - to grant the student as full an understanding as possible of the world and people around them, and to give them the tools and mindset to find advantage for themselves within the system.</li><li>

In any disagreement, the most effective tactic is to disarm. Focus the discussion on the other instead of yourself. Let them see their own mistakes. When necessary, take away the pleasure they may gain from making criticisms of you.</li></ol><ol>
</ol><ol>
</ol>
<h2>Fundamental Techniques in handling people</h2>
<ol>
<li>Don't criticize, condemn or complain.
-People will rarely agree with you on critiques.
-Criticism always returns home.
-Positive reinforcement is always more effective - seek to uplift.
__</li>
<li>Give honest and sincere appreciation.
-The human desire to be or feel important is as deep as the desire to eat or drink.
-Flattery is counterfeit and will get you into trouble if you pass it on.
-Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for.
-""Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.""
__</li>
<li>""Arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way"" ~Harry Overstreet
-""The only way on Earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it."" ~Carnegie
-""If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
~Henry Ford
-Customers like to feel that they are buying, not being sold.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Six ways</h2>
<ol>
<li>Become genuinely interested in other people.
-In making friends it is much more effective to become interested in others than to try to pique their interest in you.
-""It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring."" ~Alfred Adler
-you must be passionate about people if you intend for any of your creative work to be successful with an audience, since the artist-observer relationship is somewhat reciprocative. You must like your audience for them to like your content.
__</li>
<li>Smile.
-""You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you."" ~Carnegie
-Actions are under the control of the will, whereas emotions are not, but emotions can be controlled through actions. Hence, the only path to cheerfulness is to act as though cheer is already present.
-""Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions."" ~Carnegie
-""To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered...we are gods in the chrysalis."" ~Carnegie
__</li>
<li>""Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.' ~Carnegie
-Sometimes completing a mental portrait of someone by finding out a smattering of facts about them can be incredibly helpful to remembering their name.
-One way of bringing your employees closer to the company is to highlight them as individuals and show respect to their names. If someone has worked on something for you, show them that you are willing to work to comprehend the scale and detail and complexity of their work - admire the miniscule and obscure.
__</li>
<li>Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
-""Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention."" ~Jack Woodford, Strangers in Love
-""Even the most violent critic, will frequently soften and be subdued in the presence
of a patient, sympathetic listener.""
-Those who cause a scene often do so from a desire to feel important, but you can supplant that method by making them feel that importance in your conversation.
__</li>
<li>Talk in terms of the other person's interests.
-""The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.""
-The person will show more interest in what you have to say if you make it accessible to them.
__</li>
<li>Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.
-One all-important law of human conduct: Always make the other person feel important.
-The craving to be important is what separates human civilization from that of animals.
-""The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.""</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking</h2>
<ol><li>The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
-Nine times out of ten, an argument will only serve to deepen the conviction of each person that he is right, and so an argument is a net loss whether or not you ""win"" it.
-""A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.""
-If your opponent seeks to argue, cede their main point so that you may move past their argument and onto your own.
-""If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s goodwill."" ~Ben Franklin
-""A misunderstanding is never ended by
an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.""
-""Yield larger things to which you show no more than equal rights; and yield lesser ones though
clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.” ~Lincoln
-If you want to gain everything possible from a confrontation:
A. Welcome the disagreement.
B. Distrust your first instinctive impression.
C. Control your temper.
D. Listen first.
E. Look for areas of agreement.
F. Be honest.
G. Promise to think over your opponent's ideas and study them carefully (sense of importance).
H. Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest.
I. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem.</li>
<li>Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, ""You're wrong.""
-Telling someone they are wrong only serves to strike a direct blow against their intelligence, characterize you as self-righteous, and put them on the defensive.
-If you are going to prove anything, do it subtly.
-""Men must be taught as if you
taught them not, and things unknown proposed as things forgot."" ~Alexander Pope
-“You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself."" ~Galileo
-""Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell them so.” ~Lord Chesterfield
-“One thing only I know, and that is that I know
nothing.” ~Socrates
-""Nobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will ever object to your saying, “I may be wrong. Let’s examine the facts.”
-""You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong.""
-""Few people are logical.""
-""most of our so-called reasoning
consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do."" ~James Harvey Robinson</li><li>

If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
-""Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to say—and say them before that person has a chance to say them.""
-Always have the courage to admit your errors, and if you sense you are about to be rebuked, beat the other person to the critical punch whenever you can.
-Self-criticism is more effective, and usually more fun, than defending yourself.
-""By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than expected.""</li><li>

Begin in a friendly way.
-""'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall’. So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.” ~Lincoln
-Always take the high road - the friendly, sympathetic, appreciative approach. This will win people to your thinking and make them more open to your opinions and desires.</li><li>

Get the other person saying ""yes, yes"" immediately.
-A person must be started in the affirmative direction. Get them saying ""yes"" at the outset. If you begin with ""no"", all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself.
-""Begin by emphasizing—and keep on emphasizing—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that
you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.""
-Attitude has inertia, and you create much more convincing work for yourself if you begin in the wrong direction.
-Frame necessary action as being not for your sake, but for the other person's sake. Make the other understand your desires as common between you.
-""He who treads softly goes far."" ~Chinese proverb</li><li>

Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
-""If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.” ~La Rochefoucauld
-""When our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they—or at least some of them—will feel inferior and envious.""
-If you seek friends, ask others to share their joys with you, and only tell them of yours if asked.</li><li>

Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
-""No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.""
-“In every work of genius we recognize our
own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.” ~Ralph Waldo Emerson
-“The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.” ~Lao Tse</li><li>

Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.
-Ask yourself how your goal can be framed by their desires.
-""I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person—from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives—was likely to answer."" ~Dean Donham, Harvard Business School</li><li>

Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.
-To stop arguments and cultivate in the other both good will and rapt attention, you need only to say ""I don't blame you at all for feeling the way you do. If I were in your situation I'd feel the same way.""
-""Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.""
-Develop in yourself absolute sympathy for idiosyncrasies, even if they do not resemble your own, and people will recognize that you have taken the steps to understand their uniqueness.
-""Sympathy the human species universally craves."" ~Dr. Arthur I. Gates</li><li>

Appeal to the nobler motives.
-J.P. Morgan observed that people usually have two reasons for doing things: a real one and one that sounds good. Carnegie says ""the person himself will think of the real reason. You don’t need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler motives.
-""Nothing will work in all cases—and nothing will work with all people. If you are satisfied with the results you are now getting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why not experiment?""</li><li>

Dramatize your ideas.
-""Merely stating a truth isn't enough. The truth must be made vivid, interesting, dramatic.""
-Showmanship is not a tool of deception, but can often serve to make your idea more tangible and understandable.</li><li>

Throw down a challenge.
-“The way to get things done is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.” ~Charles Schwab
-""That is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance for self-expression. The chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win.""</li></ol>

<h2>Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment</h2>
<h2>Before you Approach:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.</li>
<li>Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.</li>
<li>Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.</li>
<li>Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.</li>
<li>Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.</li>
<li>When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.</li>
</ol>

<h2>During the Approach:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
-If you must criticize, the most effective way to do so is to first show the person what they have been doing well, and to appeal to their desire to do well further.
-Demonstrate that you have confidence in the person and their abilities to solve their problems, and frame their improvement as something they should want too.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.
-Never use the word 'but' between praise and criticism. It will deepen the impact of your criticism by contrast, and call into question the credibility and authenticity of your praise.
-Instead, always opt for the word ""and"" and frame the critique's opposite in a positive and desirable light which supplements your praise.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.
-Put yourself on their level and frame their mistakes in terms of yours, and they will be much more receptive to your criticism as advice rather than attack.
-Give not just constructive criticism but also the tools and guidance with which to construct.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Always frame orders as suggestive questions.
-Give others the pride of choosing to adopt your ideas, rather than the shame of being forced to move against their will.
-A good leader illuminates the ideal path, but makes the follower believe they are choosing it.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Always let the other person save face.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>""I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.” - Antoine de Saint-Exupery</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.
-""Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.""</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
-""If you want to improve a person in a certain aspect, act as though that particular trait were
already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.""
-""Assume a virtue, if you have it not."" -Shakespeare</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
-Work diligently alongside the other person to celebrate their progress and egg them on. Make the process sound easy and help make it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
-Also display that it would make you happy - ""I would be very glad if you would...""</li></ol>"	economics interpersonal persuasion psychology rhetoric selfperception sociology

q3,]Y&*CQI	Basic	Psych / Socio	Child Development - Sensitive Period	"Montessori theory - moment when a child's inclination/focus toward a certain kind of learning is heightened<br><br>""During their first six years of life, children move through five main 
categories of sensitive periods, including: order, language, sensory 
skills, movement, and social skills. Each sensitive period lasts for as 
long as it is necessary for a child to complete a particular stage in 
their development. These periods of special sensitivity are only 
temporary and fade once the aim is accomplished.<br><br>Other characteristics of sensitive periods may include mimicking, 
intense concentration, and compulsive or obsessive behaviours. 
Interrupting a child while they are in the middle of an intense 
sensitive period can result in a powerful emotional response such as a 
tantrum. Break a routine that a child is attempting to understand and 
master, such as getting dressed, bath time or bedtime, and some children
 will emotionally fall apart.""<br><br><ol><li><b>Order -&nbsp;</b></li><ol><li>The sensitive period for order begins at birth, peaks in the second year
 of development, and continues through to around age five.During this period of sensitivity, children may be more interested in 
putting things in order and packing things away, than they are in 
playing with their toys.&nbsp;</li><li>To support the sensitive period for order, it 
is important to establish ground rules, a solid routine, and create an 
organised environment where everything has a place.</li></ol><li><b>Language -&nbsp;</b></li><ol><li>From birth to age six, children are in the sensitive period for 
language. Sensitivity to language involves three key phases: spoken 
language, written language, and reading. The sensitive period for spoken
 language is from 7 months to 3 years of age. It begins when the child 
first creates sounds by mimicking mouth movements, and progresses over 
time, as they learn to form words and simple sentences.</li><li>The sensitive period for learning to write is from 3.5 to 4.5 years 
of age. This begins when the child learns the alphabet, and then sight 
words, which form the foundation for reading and writing skills.</li><li>For reading, a child is intensely interested from 4.5 to 5.5 years of
 age. Reading skills are often developed after a child learns to write 
as it involves visual tracking skills.</li></ol><li><b>Sensory Skills</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</li><ol><li>The first phase of sensory awareness, sensitivity to small objects, 
occurs from one to three years of age. This period can be characterised 
by a child’s fixation with small objects and tiny details.</li><li>The second sensitivity phase, sensorial exploration and classification, 
occurs from 2.5 to 6 years. This phase can be classified by an intense 
desire to take part in learning experiences that integrate the senses.</li></ol><li><b>Movement</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</li><ol><li>From birth to 2.5 years, children are sensitive to gross and fine motor 
development. This begins when the infant child learns to crawl, pull up,
 and eventually walk without assistance.</li><li>From 2.5 to 4.5 years of age, children enter the sensitive period for 
refinement and coordination of movement. This is when the child begins 
to hold items using both hands, develop the pincer grip, and control and
 coordinate movement.</li></ol><li><b>Social Skills</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</li><ol><li>From 2.5 to 5 years, children learn that they are part of a group and develop an intense interest in social relationships.</li><li>To support the development of social skills in your child, it is 
important to provide your child with opportunities to socialise with 
children their own age i.e. at playgroup or childcare. At home, you can 
model positive social behaviours, and practice grace and courtesy 
rituals such as saying “please” and “thank you.”</li></ol></ol>

<div>Some degree of stress is healthy to make us feel engaged and in it</div>
<div>Stress means life-threatening behavior, the fight or flight response.</div>
<div>Norepinephrine, Adrenaline, Cortisol</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Stress response:</div>
<div>Heart rate increase, blood drains from prefrontal cortex, blood thickens in case of injury, pupils dilate to let in more data. Digestive and reproductive systems slow. Usually prevents sleep</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The American dream is terrible for your mental health and a Porter way to construct your life around false incentives</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Is your only way to feel lovable and worthy for you to stretch yourself thin for thankless others?</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Four questions:</div>
<ol>
<li>How will your character change if you methodically become a less stressed individual, accomplishing less and pursuing happiness first?</li>
<li>What scares you about having free time and how does your work make you feel “good enough”?</li>
<li>What are your concrete beliefs around accomplishment and likely outcomes? What do you see as your Smart goal? Will it achieve what you actually want? Is it actionable?</li>
<li>Is overextending yourself actually helping?</li>
</ol>
<div><br></div>
<div>Many people use pacifiers instead of addressing underlying grief, trauma, shame</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Stress is the outweighing of our perceived capacity to accomplish by our perceived responsibilities. Also can be understood as the unpredictability between expectations and ultimate reality</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>How to decrease perceived responsibility:</div>
<ol>
<li>Identify and communicate realistic expectations, including saying NO, I WON’T MAKE DEADLINE, etc - everyone’s ultimate goal is to ship product</li>
<li>Ask for help and extra time. Delegate some tasks to others so you don’t suffer an opportunity cost from burnout.</li>
<li>Aim to satisfy. Promise no more than you can deliver; don’t feel pressure to overdeliver on your promises</li>
<li>SHIP CONSTANTLY AND IN PUBLIC SO PEOPLE CAN SEE YOUR RESULTS</li>
<li>clarify your desire to do something from your availability for it</li>
</ol>
<div><br></div>
<div>Our expectations for ourselves lie somewhere between what we perceive and what we perceive others to perceive</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Increase your perceived capacity</div>
<ol>
<li>Optimize physical well being; exercise, sleep, cut caffeine, eat well and consistently, use drugs for non-stress reasons.</li>
<li>Build white space into your calendar, aka stress insurance. Don’t book a bad season ahead just because you’re currently in an available season</li>
<li>Connect with others for casual interaction as much as possible outside the workplace</li>
<li>Self-compassion: hold yourself to reasonable standards and expectations, and give yourself the same kindness/support you would show to someone stressed</li>

The death of ritual processes for initiating boys into manhood; pseudo-initiations or mere ceremonials take their place
""Patriarchy is the expression of the immature masculine.""
""Boys fear women. They also fear real men.""
Death is a vital part of any initiatory ritual.
""Boys who are too bound to the mother get hurt.""
""The 'death' of the hero in the life of a boy (or man) really means that he has finally encountered his limitations. He has met the enemy, and the enemy is himself.""
We access the mature masculine through true humility. True humility consists of two things: knowing our limitations and getting the help we need.</div>
<h2>King</h2>
<div>Leadership &amp; stewardship
""This is the clear decision, after careful deliberation, that cuts through the mess in the family, at work, in the nation, in the world.""
All mature masculine energies require healthy distance and orbit: the star gives you life, but you are not the star</div>
<h2>Warrior</h2>
<div>Aggressiveness, determination, drive to win.
The warrior is incapable of intimacy and perceives women as objects
Perfectionism, compulsion, the urge to act
Drive to ignore pain for worthwhile goals
Skill &amp; speed during direct confrontations with people, decisions, tasks</div>
<h2>Magician</h2>
<div>Knowledge, technology, mysticism and storytelling
Seer of evil, keeper of rationality and logic
Psychotherapy, cleric
Awareness, insight and perception
Introversion, detachment, objectivity
Bipolar shadow: manipulation, deception, fraud
Must be mediated by Kings generativity and generosity, warrior's decisive and courageous action, and lover's deep and convinced connectedness.</div>
<h2>Lover</h2>
<div>Aestheticism, sensitivity, compassion
Mediates between love and duty
Opposes boundaries/containment/order/discipline like the other three archetypes
Bipolar shadow: the addict, who becomes too enthralled with the senses and loses control of his own fate (the idealist)
Passive shadow: putting something on a pedestal so high that you give up on it</div>

ggQ[4d*;z|	Basic	Psych / Socio	Procrastination	"<div>Managing emotions: you need to be able to recognize your negative emotions associated with approaching tasks you tend to procrastinate on, and realize that procrastination is primarily about ""feeling good now"".</div>
<div>Realize that the good feelings you get from accomplishing a task should be used as motivation to continue to work and make progress, not an excuse to celebrate/procrastinate more, e.g. work late for an essay due the next morning, then do nothing about your exam next week after you turn in your essay since you feel good about having accomplished one assignment.</div>
<div>Procrastinators often suffer from lack of identity, don't know what they want to achieve, or why they want to achieve it.</div>
<div>People who are 'social perfectionists' and are motivated to work because of other people's/society's expectations rather than their own sense of accomplishment are more likely to procrastinate.</div>
<div>At a high level, tasks often seem insurmountable since they are so vague. e.g. ""working on my thesis"" or ""studying for my class"" often means doing nothing, whereas ""reading 4 pages of a textbook to understand a concept i need to summarize in my thesis"" is a concrete, broken down goal.</div>
<div>Most important technique introduced at the end 54:11: Be intentional about your implementation. Instead of ""I'll work on my task all day saturday"" (which few people ever do successfully), use the formula: In situation x, I will do y to achieve subgoal z. By identifying your situation, action, and goal, you have broken down the task into an easily achievable, chewable piece.</div>"	behavior formula habit persuasion technique
