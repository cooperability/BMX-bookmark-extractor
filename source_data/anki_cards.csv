Conversational Psychology,Conversational Psychology,"I’m someone who has to actively listen to people for a living (and married to someone who feels compelled to frequently interrupt me for periodic, verbal affirmations).<br><br>Body language can be your best (and least disruptive) friend. Try the following things and I’m confident your friends/family/colleagues will feel you’re engaged (albeit silent).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At its most basic level, look at the person. In particular, if you slightly cock your head to the side when they’re talking, it’s one of my favorite ways of demonstrating interest and/or curiosity (if you don’t know what this looks like, picture a curious puppy who is listening to their human speak). Then, occasionally punctuate the head tilt with a few small nods (when they say something of particular note).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you’re able to take notes while someone talks (e.g. it’s a work meeting or you’re on a phone call), that can often help tie up your brain (in a good way) while they talk. It’s also another non-disruptive way of showing interest. In contrast, if I’m sharing a ton of information with someone (particularly in a professional setting) and they’re not taking notes, I’m highly skeptical of their ability (and intent) to remember anything I’m saying.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaning forward (e.g. in a chair) can also be a good non-verbal indication of being engaged, whereas leaning backwards (away from the speaker) can indicate the opposite.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you start looking at your watch/phone or over their shoulder, people notice. This can actually be helpful when you want to get OUT of a conversation. Similarly, be mindful of any other body language (mannerisms) that can demonstrate impatience. For example, some people start to bounce their leg or fidget.<br><br>If you’re able to patiently wait for the person to complete their thoughts, here are some verbal responses I use all the time, which demonstrate I’m engaged and actively listening:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let me see if I’m understanding correctly… &lt;restate what they said in your own words&gt;” Funny enough, even if you restate 100% accurately, it often makes the other person want to talk more (expound upon things or provide more detail). Use at your own risk. :)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Could you tell me more about… &lt;something they said&gt;?” I love this one because I can guide the conversation towards something in the conversation that I’m interested in, while simultaneously showing that I’m actively listening.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Thank you for sharing that.” Very simple and nothing fancy, but it’s effective. Expressing some sign of gratitude for someone’s contribution to the conversation is a good way to make their contributions feel valued, especially if you have nothing further to say/ask. As an optional (but powerful) bonus, you can add in a quick note about how something they said has meaning to you (e.g. you can relate to it, it taught you something, etc.). Likewise, expressing gratitude can be a great time to end the conversation or transition the conversation to something else.",Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health),behavior;sociology

How to Grow Your Career in AI - Andrew Ng handbook for Fourthbrain.ai,How to Grow Your Career in AI - Andrew Ng handbook for Fourthbrain.ai,"""**5-Paragraph Summary**<br><br>**Introduction:**<br>Andrew Ng's guide to career growth in AI emphasizes the transformative power of AI, likening coding for AI to a new form of literacy. He draws parallels between historical literacy and the current trajectory of AI, suggesting that just as reading and writing became fundamental skills for societal advancement, so too will the ability to code and work with AI (Page 4).<br><br>**First Major Movement:**<br>Ng outlines a three-step framework for career growth in AI: learning foundational skills, working on projects, and finding a job. He stresses that learning is a lifelong process, especially in a rapidly evolving field like AI. Foundational skills include understanding machine learning models and core concepts, deep learning, relevant mathematics, and software development. Ng advises that organized courses are often the most efficient way to master these skills (Pages 5-10).<br><br>**Second Major Movement:**<br>The author discusses the importance of scoping successful AI projects. He provides a five-step process for identifying and developing AI solutions to real-world problems. This involves understanding business problems, brainstorming AI solutions, assessing feasibility and value, determining milestones, and budgeting for resources. Ng emphasizes the iterative nature of this process and encourages seeking impactful projects even without deep domain expertise (Pages 14-16).<br><br>**Third Major Movement:**<br>Ng touches on the role of math in AI, suggesting that while a deep understanding of mathematics can be beneficial, especially for debugging and optimizing algorithms, the necessity varies with the maturity of the technology. He encourages learning driven by curiosity and the pursuit of continuous learning to stay abreast of the rapidly changing field (Pages 12-13).<br><br>**Conclusion:**<br>In conclusion, Ng's book provides a comprehensive roadmap for individuals looking to grow their careers in AI. The focus is on continuous learning, practical project experience, and the strategic application of AI to solve meaningful problems. He advocates for a balanced approach to learning technical skills, understanding the math behind AI, and the importance of community and collaboration in this journey (Pages 1-17).<br><br>**10 Bullet Points Highlighting Important Case Studies/Examples:**<br><br>1. **AI as the New Electricity:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ng compares AI's potential impact to that of electricity, suggesting it will permeate and enhance all aspects of human life (Page 2).<br><br>2. **The Pizza Parlor Example:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - A practical illustration of how AI can be applied in everyday life, such as a pizza maker using linear regression to optimize supply chain and staffing (Page 4).<br><br>3. **Career Framework Application:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ng's framework is applied to AI, with unique challenges such as the need for continuous learning due to the nascent nature of AI technologies (Pages 6-7).<br><br>4. **Importance of Foundational Skills:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Emphasizes the necessity of understanding machine learning models, deep learning, and the relevant math and software development skills (Pages 8-9).<br><br>5. **Learning as a Habit:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Recommends starting small to build the habit of continuous learning, drawing from BJ Fogg's """"Tiny Habits"""" methodology (Page 11).<br><br>6. **Math in AI:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Discusses the varying importance of math in AI roles, with an emphasis on understanding algorithms for better decision-making (Page 13).<br><br>7. **Scoping AI Projects:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Provides a step-by-step approach to identifying and developing AI projects that can have a real-world impact (Pages 14-16).<br><br>8. **Iterative Project Development:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Highlights the iterative nature of AI project development, where one must be willing to revisit and revise steps based on new insights (Page 16).<br><br>9. **Educational Approach:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Advocates for structured learning through courses for a coherent understanding over disjointed internet resources (Page 10).<br><br>10. **The Role of Community:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Stresses the importance of building a supportive community for help and collaboration throughout one's AI career journey (Page 7).<br><br>**5 Bottom-Line Pieces of Actionable Advice:**<br><br>1. **Embrace Lifelong Learning:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Successful AI professionals engage in continuous learning to keep up with the evolving field.<br><br>2. **Prioritize Practical Experience:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Hands-on projects are crucial for deepening skills and building a portfolio that demonstrates skill progression.<br><br>3. **Understand Business Implications:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - AI professionals should focus on identifying business problems that AI can solve, not just AI problems in isolation.<br><br>4. **Cultivate Coding Literacy:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Coding, especially in AI-related technologies, is becoming as essential as traditional literacy once was.<br><br>5. **Build a Supportive Network:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - A community of peers and mentors is invaluable for support, learning, and navigating the AI career landscape.<br><br>We finished processing the whole document with the PDF Search plugin.

It begins by establishing that successful stakeholder engagement involves clear communication about deliverables, timelines, and the value UX brings. Key approaches like the Double Diamond and upfront Experience Strategy are highlighted, stressing the importance of research (e.g., Lean Model Canvases, competitive analysis) and data-driven decision-making to align with business goals and user needs. As the instructor states, """"Data is always the key to winning any pushback,"""" underscoring the necessity of evidence in guiding product direction and gaining stakeholder buy-in. Collaboration, especially within Agile frameworks, is presented as essential, urging UX to """"jump in and collaborate"""" by involving product and engineering in activities like sketching sessions and user interviews.</div><br><div>Effective communication extends to how UX findings and proposals are presented. The course advises tailoring presentations to different audiences (from C-level executives to direct team members), always focusing on user needs, supporting data, and demonstrable measurements of success. """"Make sure the rest is in an appendix, and include all of your facts,"""" is a practical tip for executive presentations. Evangelizing UX is a core Design Ops function, involving the establishment of clear processes, creating valuable resources like case studies (""""Celebrate your successes. Make sure your stakeholders know why it matters and the impact made""""), and fostering a culture where UX is understood and valued. This proactive education helps dispel myths about UX merely """"making things pretty"""" and showcases its strategic importance.</div><br><div>Integrating stakeholders deeply into the UX workflow is a recurring theme, positioned as a method to gain consensus and ensure UX has a """"seat at the table."""" This involves not just informing but actively involving them in research activities like usability testing note-taking, and workshops for creating user journeys or empathy maps. The course stresses, """"Design is an assumption until validated with real users,"""" a mantra to be shared with stakeholders to underscore the importance of research. Educating stakeholders about research methods, their costs, and benefits through formats like """"lunch and learns"""" can foster understanding and easier participation. Centralizing research findings and making them accessible is also key for transparency and collective understanding.</div><br><div>Finally, the course delves into the practical application of design thinking and direct stakeholder interaction. It advocates for """"design plans"""" and focusing on outcomes over outputs. Key design thinking activities like creating empathy maps, user research plans, Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD), and journey maps are presented as valuable deliverables that should clearly articulate how they address user pain points. Stakeholder interviews are crucial """"before anything else"""" to understand perspectives and build trust. The entire process, from ideation and sketching to prototyping and usability testing (""""test early and often""""), should be collaborative and iterative, with deliverables packaged professionally to reflect the maturity and value of the UX team within the organization.</div><br><div><span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">**Key Takeaways &amp; Actionable Advice:**</span></div><br><div>* &nbsp; <span style=""""font-weight: bold;"""">**Foundational Stakeholder Management &amp; UX Strategy**</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Clearly define and communicate deliverables, including what stakeholders will get and when.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Employ Experience Strategy principles before projects begin, bringing user perspectives alongside business, product, and engineering.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Actionable Advice: """"Do the research create a lean model canvas, et cetera, and present it along with any and all data to back up your findings.""""</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Why: Data provides objective evidence to guide product direction and win stakeholder support.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Actionable Advice: Work within Agile methodologies; """"UX groans and moans about doing demos as an example.

This is particularly useful for tasks that are time-consuming or need to be executed at a later time, without making the user wait for the task to complete. Let's break this down into more detail, including the terminology and the roles of Django, synchronous/asynchronous execution, Django workers, and Redis in the context of a job queue.</div><h3>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Execution</h3><ul><li><strong>Synchronous Execution</strong>: The code is executed in sequence, meaning that a task must complete before the next one starts. In a web application, this can lead to blocking I/O operations, making the user wait for the task to complete before the webpage can be updated or responded to.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous Execution</strong>: This allows the program to move on to another task before the previous one has completed. It's beneficial for tasks that are I/O bound or require waiting for external resources. Asynchronous execution can improve the throughput and responsiveness of a web application by not blocking the execution thread with long-running tasks.</li></ul><h3>Django and Asynchronous Tasks</h3><div>Django is a synchronous framework by default, designed to handle HTTP requests and responses in a linear fashion. However, Django can integrate with asynchronous job queues to offload tasks that don't need to be completed within the lifecycle of a single request.</div><h3>Job Queue</h3><div>A job queue is a mechanism for scheduling tasks to be executed asynchronously. Tasks are added to a queue, where they wait to be processed by a worker. The queue ensures tasks are executed in the order they were added or based on priority levels.</div><h3>Django Workers</h3><div>Django workers are processes or threads that run separately from the main application server. Their job is to listen for tasks in the job queue, execute them, and return the results. The workers run outside the request-response cycle, allowing them to handle time-consuming operations without affecting the responsiveness of the web application.</div><h3>Redis</h3><div>Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used as a message broker for Django job queues. It provides a fast and efficient way to implement a job queue because of its support for various data structures like lists, which can be used to manage the queue of tasks. Redis serves as the intermediary between Django and the workers, holding the tasks until a worker is available to process them.</div><h3>Implementing a Job Queue in Django</h3><ol><li><strong>Choose a Task Queue Library</strong>: Libraries like Celery, Django-RQ (Redis Queue), and Huey are popular choices for integrating asynchronous task queues with Django. These libraries allow you to define tasks (functions) that can be executed asynchronously.</li><li><strong>Setup a Message Broker</strong>: The message broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) holds messages (tasks) that are sent from Django until the workers pick them up for execution. Redis is often chosen for its simplicity and performance.</li><li><strong>Define Tasks</strong>: With the chosen library, you'll define tasks that you want to run asynchronously. This involves decorating functions you wish to run in the background.</li><li><strong>Run Workers</strong>: Workers need to be started separately from the Django application. They continuously listen for new tasks added to the queue and execute them.</li><li><strong>Enqueue Tasks</strong>: From your Django application, enqueue tasks to be executed asynchronously. The library will handle the communication with the message broker (e.g., Redis) to queue the tasks.</li></ol></li></ol></ol><li>FastAPI outperforms by a factor of 2 or 3, but has much less sophisticated capabilities</li><ol><li>FastAPI is a modern Python&nbsp;web framework designed specifically for building APIs quickly and efficiently. It leverages standard Python type hints for automatic data validation, serialization, and documentation generation&nbsp;(giving you interactive API docs like Swagger UI out-of-the-box). It's built on asynchronous principles&nbsp;(async/await), making it very performant for I/O-bound tasks (like network requests to databases or other services), and its dependency injection system simplifies managing resources like database connections.<br></li></ol><li>Flask is most popular for beginners</li></ol><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>If you want all the Django routes, just misspell a route and django should dump them all in the error:</div><div><img src=""""Screenshot_2024-11-04_124720.webp""""><br></div>""",CompSci (AIML/Web3/Math/Logic/Tech),dataflow;Example;formula;webdev

This is excellent for&nbsp;<span style=""""font-weight: 600;"""">accessibility</span>&nbsp;because if a user changes their browser's default font size, elements&nbsp;sized with&nbsp;rem&nbsp;will scale proportionally, making the site more readable.
