<u>Transduction</u>: transformation of light
energy to electrical signals</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Photoreceptors transform light
energy (photons) to electrical signals. There are two types of photoreceptors
(rods and cones) which both absorb photons and generate an electrical
potential. Thus, both rods and cones perform transduction.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt=""A picture containing circuit

Description automatically generated"" src=""clip_image001.png""><u>Dark adaptation</u>: The time it takes
photoreceptors to reach their maximal sensitivity in low light conditions</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although
rods and cones both perform transduction, their sensitivity to the light is
different. As you can see from the figure on the right, rods have much lower
threshold than the cones. This suggests that rods are more sensitive than
cones, as transduction in rods occurs at lower light intensities than in cones.
Therefore, night vision is based on rods. However, as you might have noticed
from the ‘time in the dark (min)’, it takes rods longer time than cones to
reach maximal sensitivity. To be specific, for cones it takes about 8 mins to
reach the maximal sensitivity while, it takes about 20 mins for rods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Wavelength encoding</u>: Different
photoreceptors have pigments that absorb light at different wavelengths,
forming the basis for color vision </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All rods have the same
photopigment (rhodopsin) while, cones have 3 kinds of photopigments, which
respond to long, medium, and short wavelengths. As we can see from the figure
below, each photoreceptor observes a range of wavelengths, not a single wavelength.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;<u>Data
compression: </u>why we see blurry in the periphery. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Spatial distribution of photoreceptors
is not uniform across the retina. We have more cones in the fovea than
periphery. In contrast, we have more rods in the periphery (their density peaks
at round 20 deg) and have almost no rods in the fovea. Therefore, fovea is
dominated by the signals from the cones and periphery is dominated by the
signals of the rods.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Many-to-one relationship is found
in the periphery. Inputs from as many as 50 photoreceptors converge to a single
ganglion cell. &nbsp;Pooling information from
multiple photoreceptors increases visual sensitivity (ability to detect/perceive
light), which makes rod system to function well in dim light conditions.
However, as the information is coming from multiple photoreceptors, the peripheral
vision has low visual acuity (the finest detail that can be resolved by the
eyes).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Whereas, in the fovea, cones tend
to have one-to-one relationship with the ganglion cells. This one-to-one
relationship results in increase in visual acuity and decrease in sensitivity
to light. This is why we see clear images in the fovea and blurry images in the
periphery.</div>

uIq7o0UE8r	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	Place Coding vs Temporal Coding	"Place coding in Cochlea vs time coding in auditory nerve<br><br>The nature of pitch and its neural coding have been studied for over a 
century. A popular debate has revolved around the question of whether 
pitch is coded via “place” cues in the cochlea, or via timing cues in 
the auditory nerve. In the most recent incarnation of this debate, the 
role of temporal fine structure has been emphasized in conveying 
important pitch and speech information, particularly because the lack of
 temporal fine structure coding in cochlear implants might explain some 
of the difficulties faced by cochlear implant users in perceiving music 
and pitch contours in speech. In addition, some studies have postulated 
that hearing-impaired listeners may have a specific deficit related to 
processing temporal fine structure. This article reviews some of the 
recent literature surrounding the debate, and argues that much of the 
recent evidence suggesting the importance of temporal fine structure 
processing can also be accounted for using spectral (place) or 
temporal-envelope cues."	perception
M%qxY.aq@W	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	Fundamental Frequency &amp; Harmonics	"what we hear as
          a single sound or pitch when someone is speaking (for example,
          when making the sound [i]) is really a <i>fundamental
            frequency </i>基頻 (determined by how many times the vocal
          folds vibrate in one second, and measured in cycles per second
          [cps], or hertz 赫 [Hz]; named after the German physicist <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz"">Heinrich Rudolf Hertz</a>), plus a whole
          series of <i>harmonics</i> 諧音 (often called 泛音 on stringed instruments)
            or <i>overtones</i> 倍音. These


          terms overlap in meaning, but: ""harmonic"" includes the
          fundamental frequency and all of the overtones above it, while
          ""overtones"" include all frequencies <b>greater </b><b>than</b>
          the fundamental frequency. <br>
<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The harmonics are <i>multiples of
            the fundamental frequency</i>. So if the fundamental
          frequency is 100 Hz, the higher harmonics will be 200 Hz, 300
          Hz, 400 Hz, 500 Hz, and so on. If the fundamental frequency
          were 220 Hz, the harmonics would be 440 Hz, 660 Hz, 880 Hz,
          and so on. In terms of intervals on the scale, we hear a base
          tone, its octave (eight notes up), then a note that is a
          twelfth up, i.e. a perfect fifth above the octave above the
          starting pitch, then a note two octaves up from the starting
          pitch, then one that is a major third above that, and on and
          on.<br><br>&nbsp;We normally don't hear the harmonics as
          separate tones, first of all because they have an increasingly
          lower amplitude than the fundamental frequency the higher up
          they go.<br><br><a href=""https://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~karchung/phonetics%20II%20page%20eight.htm"">https://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~karchung/phonetics II page eight.htm</a>"	perception

The brain perceives the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)"">pitch</a> of a tone not only by its fundamental frequency, but also by the periodicity implied by the relationship between the higher <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic"">harmonics</a>; we may perceive the same pitch (perhaps with a different <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre"">timbre</a>) even if the fundamental frequency is missing from a tone.

 it will consist of frequency components that are integer multiples of

the length of the membrane. Nerves that transmit information from

tonotopically. This tonotopy then projects through the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_system#Central_auditory_system"">vestibulocochlear nerve and associated midbrain structures</a>
 to the primary auditory cortex via the auditory radiation pathway.

</div></div></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>The visual

geniculate nucleus (LGN), where they first
synapse and then continue along the optic
radiation to cortex. There, we find the second
synapse at primary visual cortex (also referred
to as V1, striate cortex or area 17).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Visual areas are arranged in (at least) two processing streams emerging from early
visual areas (V1, V2 and V3). One stream, referred to as the <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">dorsal stream</span>, ascends dorsally
from early visual cortex to areas along the parietal lobe. The second, <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">ventral stream</span>, on the
other hand, continues from early visual areas to the ventral aspect of the temporal lobe. These
two pathways are thought to serve different functions.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<b>Ungerleidger and Mishkin’s famous 1982 experiment. -&nbsp;</b>lesions to dorsal &amp; ventral stream with associated disruptions to ""where"" &amp; ""what"" tasks, respectively. These two pathways have been dubbed the “what” (ventral) and “where” (dorsal)
pathways (Ungerleider &amp; Mishkin, 1982).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>They found that lesions in parietal cortex produced deficits in the “where” task but not
the “what” task, while lesions in temporal cortex produced deficits in the “what” task but not the
“where” task. These results indicated a <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">double dissociation </span>of function across the dorsal and
ventral pathways. A double dissociation is evident if one manipulation affects the first variable
and not the second, while the other manipulation affects the second variable and not the first. In
our case, a lesion to the parietal lobe affects spatial perception but not recognition, while a
lesion to the temporal lobe affects recognition but not spatial perception.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>In humans, damage to end stages of the ventral stream can cause deficits in object
recognition called <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">visual agnosias</span>. A visual agnosia is defined as an impairment in object
recognition that can’t be attributed to a general loss in intelligence or elementary visual
perceptual losses such as in brightness, acuity, depth or color. Check out the patient video in
module 5 (“NOVA-stranger in the mirror”) for an example. Damage to end stages of the dorsal
stream, on the other hand, produces deficits in spatial perception and grasping. One example is
unilateral neglect, an impairment of spatial vision in which patients fail to notice things in the
visual field opposite (contralateral) to their damaged or lesioned hemisphere (check out
“neglect.mov” for an example patient). These disorders are consistent with Ungerleider and
Mishkin’s conceptualization of the ventral stream as a “what” pathway and the dorsal stream as
a “where” pathway.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><div>
<div>
<div>
<div>However, based on a patient with a different lesion and disorder, Goodale and Milner
(1992) proposed a different function for the dorsal stream. Specifically, they proposed that the
dorsal stream is instead best characterized as a “how” processing stream, which is involved in
visually guided actions. Goodale and Milner also devised two tasks - a perceptual matching
task, in which the participant was instructed to indicate the orientation of card (e.g.
vertical/horizontal) and a second, visuomotor posting task, in which the participant was
instructed to rotate a card so they could post it though an oriented slot. They found that a
patient, “DF”, with a lesion to the ventral stream, failed the perceptual task, suggesting that she
did not have visual form perception, as predicted by Ungerleider and Mishkin’s theory. However,
DF surprisingly still performed well at the visuomotor posting task. A second patient, “RV”, on
the other hand, had a lesion to their dorsal stream and despite being able to perform well on the
perceptual matching task, failed the visuomotor posting task. This inability to use visual
information to reach out and grasp objects, while at the same time having no difficulty in
recognizing or describing objects in the impaired visual field is called <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">object ataxia</span>. An example
video can be seen here.
</div>
<div>Thus, Goodale and Milner also provide evidence for a double dissociation between the

involvement in visually guided action. This is in contrast to Ungerleider and Mishkin’s proposed
role for the dorsal stream: spatial localization. The role of different visual processing streams, as

rJK<*;I/~s	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	The Upward Spiral, Alex Korb PhD	Everything is interconnected. Gratitude improves sleep. Sleep reduces pain. Reduced pain improves your mood. Improved mood reduces anxiety, which improves focus and planning. Focus and planning help with decision making. Decision making further reduces anxiety and improves enjoyment. Enjoyment gives you more to be grateful for, which keeps that loop of the upward spiral going. Enjoyment also makes it more likely you’ll exercise and be social, which, in turn, will make you happier.	behavior book emotion

tMu!%I&Rtc	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	Conversational Psychology	I’m someone who has to actively listen to people for a living (and married to someone who feels compelled to frequently interrupt me for periodic, verbal affirmations).<br><br>Body language can be your best (and least disruptive) friend. Try the following things and I’m confident your friends/family/colleagues will feel you’re engaged (albeit silent).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At its most basic level, look at the person. In particular, if you slightly cock your head to the side when they’re talking, it’s one of my favorite ways of demonstrating interest and/or curiosity (if you don’t know what this looks like, picture a curious puppy who is listening to their human speak). Then, occasionally punctuate the head tilt with a few small nods (when they say something of particular note).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you’re able to take notes while someone talks (e.g. it’s a work meeting or you’re on a phone call), that can often help tie up your brain (in a good way) while they talk. It’s also another non-disruptive way of showing interest. In contrast, if I’m sharing a ton of information with someone (particularly in a professional setting) and they’re not taking notes, I’m highly skeptical of their ability (and intent) to remember anything I’m saying.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaning forward (e.g. in a chair) can also be a good non-verbal indication of being engaged, whereas leaning backwards (away from the speaker) can indicate the opposite.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you start looking at your watch/phone or over their shoulder, people notice. This can actually be helpful when you want to get OUT of a conversation. Similarly, be mindful of any other body language (mannerisms) that can demonstrate impatience. For example, some people start to bounce their leg or fidget.<br><br>If you’re able to patiently wait for the person to complete their thoughts, here are some verbal responses I use all the time, which demonstrate I’m engaged and actively listening:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Let me see if I’m understanding correctly… &lt;restate what they said in your own words&gt;” Funny enough, even if you restate 100% accurately, it often makes the other person want to talk more (expound upon things or provide more detail). Use at your own risk. :)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Could you tell me more about… &lt;something they said&gt;?” I love this one because I can guide the conversation towards something in the conversation that I’m interested in, while simultaneously showing that I’m actively listening.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Thank you for sharing that.” Very simple and nothing fancy, but it’s effective. Expressing some sign of gratitude for someone’s contribution to the conversation is a good way to make their contributions feel valued, especially if you have nothing further to say/ask. As an optional (but powerful) bonus, you can add in a quick note about how something they said has meaning to you (e.g. you can relate to it, it taught you something, etc.). Likewise, expressing gratitude can be a great time to end the conversation or transition the conversation to something else.	behavior sociology

<div>But he and other scientists believe the recent findings also 
highlight a deeper conceptual problem in neuroscience. “We divide the

that causes the behavior,” LeDoux said.</div></div><br>Cisek has already used his new breakdown of brain activities to explain 
why, for instance, the basal ganglia plays a key role in some 
decision-making tasks but not others. “You realize that neither the term
 ‘decision-making’ nor the term ‘attention’ actually corresponds to a 
thing in the brain,” he said. “Instead, there are certain very pragmatic
 circuits in the brain, and they do certain things like ‘approach’ or 
‘avoid.’ … Some of those things are going to look a bit like attention.”<br><a href=""https://www.quantamagazine.org/mental-phenomena-dont-map-into-the-brain-as-expected-20210824/?utm_source=Stanford+Report&amp;utm_campaign=95f48171e1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_25_03_17&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_29ce9f751e-95f48171e1-53322833"">https://www.quantamagazine.org/mental-phenomena-dont-map-into-the-brain-as-expected-20210824/?utm_source=Stanford+Report&amp;utm_campaign=95f48171e1-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_08_25_03_17&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_29ce9f751e-95f48171e1-53322833</a><br>"	history neurobiology perception psychology

B~~%pLC^l_	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	American Men are Broken	"<div>Here is one of the biggest problems facing America: Boys and men across all regions and ethnic groups have been failing, both absolutely and relatively, for years. This is catastrophic for our country.</div>
<div>The data are clear. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to be diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; are five times as likely to spend time in juvenile detention; and are less likely to finish high school.</div>
<div>Unfortunately, it doesn’t get better when boys become adults. Men now make up only 40.5 percent of college students. Male community college enrollment declined by 14.7 percent in 2020 alone, compared with 6.8 percent for women. Median wages for men have declined since 1990 in real terms. Roughly one-third of men are either unemployed or out of the workforce. More U.S. men ages 18 to 34 are now living with their parents than with romantic partners.</div>

<div>Address your CIRCUMSTANCES before your SYMPTOMS</div>
<div>Brain traffic management, or lack thereof usually causes the majority of mental health issues</div>
<ul>
<li>pre frontal cortex executive function, problem solving, goal setting, social interactions
-most recent human brain evolution, primarily to distinguish us from primates.
-takes longest to grow of any brain part
-ventral PFC, back of PFC, hostess emotion</li>
</ul>
<div>PFC has its information vetted by the ACC, which registers communication between the thinking brain and the feeling brain</div>
<div>Spindle neurons are long anD send signals much faster than other neurons
Scientists think feeling and thinking more are part of evolution to higher cognition</div>
<div>If the pre frontal cortex does the thinking, the limbic system(amygdala &amp; hippocampus) does the feeling
Limbic system enshrines trauma &amp; stores memories
Amygdala’s job is to relate memories to emotions, to manage episodic autobiographical memories (eam) - evidence-based knowledge</div>
<div>Memories are stored as stories with emotions attached</div>
<div>Fight, flight or freeze- it’s the brain stem
First part of brain to evolve

<div>Storytelling is the default mode of our brains, but can be visceral over objectivity, can finger more than facts
PFC holds seven pieces of information, plus or minus two</div>
<div>The amygdala often wrests control from the PFC
Stimulus discrimination allows us to rationally sift through stimulus data, occurs constantly in the PFC and is disrupted by amygdala activity</div>
<div>#PTSD
In that ptsd is failure to recover from trauma, we can’t diagnose it within the first month after a trauma incident - we don’t yet know whether we’ll recover or not</div>
<div>#emotions
Emotions are evolutionarily meant to last no longer than 90 seconds, so that they don’t impede decision making
Rumination and avoidance are our brain’s way of creating a sense of control in uncontrollable situations
Feels safer than examining a situation and letting it go
Not much difference with healing methods over time, but the rapidness with which you address the trauma matters a ton

The best way to take in the world is to be fascinated by, and grateful for, every shred of learning you can gain.</li>
<li>

The great purpose of an education is orientation - to grant the student as full an understanding as possible of the world and people around them, and to give them the tools and mindset to find advantage for themselves within the system.</li><li>

In any disagreement, the most effective tactic is to disarm. Focus the discussion on the other instead of yourself. Let them see their own mistakes. When necessary, take away the pleasure they may gain from making criticisms of you.</li></ol><ol>
</ol><ol>
</ol>
<h2>Fundamental Techniques in handling people</h2>
<ol>
<li>Don't criticize, condemn or complain.
-People will rarely agree with you on critiques.
-Criticism always returns home.
-Positive reinforcement is always more effective - seek to uplift.
__</li>
<li>Give honest and sincere appreciation.
-The human desire to be or feel important is as deep as the desire to eat or drink.
-Flattery is counterfeit and will get you into trouble if you pass it on.
-Hurting people not only does not change them, it is never called for.
-""Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.""
__</li>
<li>""Arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way"" ~Harry Overstreet
-""The only way on Earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it."" ~Carnegie
-""If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.”
~Henry Ford
-Customers like to feel that they are buying, not being sold.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Six ways</h2>
<ol>
<li>Become genuinely interested in other people.
-In making friends it is much more effective to become interested in others than to try to pique their interest in you.
-""It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring."" ~Alfred Adler
-you must be passionate about people if you intend for any of your creative work to be successful with an audience, since the artist-observer relationship is somewhat reciprocative. You must like your audience for them to like your content.
__</li>
<li>Smile.
-""You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you."" ~Carnegie
-Actions are under the control of the will, whereas emotions are not, but emotions can be controlled through actions. Hence, the only path to cheerfulness is to act as though cheer is already present.
-""Happiness doesn't depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions."" ~Carnegie
-""To think rightly is to create. All things come through desire and every sincere prayer is answered...we are gods in the chrysalis."" ~Carnegie
__</li>
<li>""Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.' ~Carnegie
-Sometimes completing a mental portrait of someone by finding out a smattering of facts about them can be incredibly helpful to remembering their name.
-One way of bringing your employees closer to the company is to highlight them as individuals and show respect to their names. If someone has worked on something for you, show them that you are willing to work to comprehend the scale and detail and complexity of their work - admire the miniscule and obscure.
__</li>
<li>Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
-""Few human beings are proof against the implied flattery of rapt attention."" ~Jack Woodford, Strangers in Love
-""Even the most violent critic, will frequently soften and be subdued in the presence
of a patient, sympathetic listener.""
-Those who cause a scene often do so from a desire to feel important, but you can supplant that method by making them feel that importance in your conversation.
__</li>
<li>Talk in terms of the other person's interests.
-""The royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.""
-The person will show more interest in what you have to say if you make it accessible to them.
__</li>
<li>Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.
-One all-important law of human conduct: Always make the other person feel important.
-The craving to be important is what separates human civilization from that of animals.
-""The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.""</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking</h2>
<ol><li>The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.
-Nine times out of ten, an argument will only serve to deepen the conviction of each person that he is right, and so an argument is a net loss whether or not you ""win"" it.
-""A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.""
-If your opponent seeks to argue, cede their main point so that you may move past their argument and onto your own.
-""If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent’s goodwill."" ~Ben Franklin
-""A misunderstanding is never ended by
an argument but by tact, diplomacy, conciliation and a sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.""
-""Yield larger things to which you show no more than equal rights; and yield lesser ones though
clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.” ~Lincoln
-If you want to gain everything possible from a confrontation:
A. Welcome the disagreement.
B. Distrust your first instinctive impression.
C. Control your temper.
D. Listen first.
E. Look for areas of agreement.
F. Be honest.
G. Promise to think over your opponent's ideas and study them carefully (sense of importance).
H. Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest.
I. Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem.</li>
<li>Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, ""You're wrong.""
-Telling someone they are wrong only serves to strike a direct blow against their intelligence, characterize you as self-righteous, and put them on the defensive.
-If you are going to prove anything, do it subtly.
-""Men must be taught as if you
taught them not, and things unknown proposed as things forgot."" ~Alexander Pope
-“You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself."" ~Galileo
-""Be wiser than other people if you can, but do not tell them so.” ~Lord Chesterfield
-“One thing only I know, and that is that I know
nothing.” ~Socrates
-""Nobody in the heavens above or on earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will ever object to your saying, “I may be wrong. Let’s examine the facts.”
-""You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong.""
-""Few people are logical.""
-""most of our so-called reasoning
consists in finding arguments for going on believing as we already do."" ~James Harvey Robinson</li><li>

If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
-""Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to say—and say them before that person has a chance to say them.""
-Always have the courage to admit your errors, and if you sense you are about to be rebuked, beat the other person to the critical punch whenever you can.
-Self-criticism is more effective, and usually more fun, than defending yourself.
-""By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than expected.""</li><li>

Begin in a friendly way.
-""'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall’. So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.” ~Lincoln
-Always take the high road - the friendly, sympathetic, appreciative approach. This will win people to your thinking and make them more open to your opinions and desires.</li><li>

Get the other person saying ""yes, yes"" immediately.
-A person must be started in the affirmative direction. Get them saying ""yes"" at the outset. If you begin with ""no"", all your pride of personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself.
-""Begin by emphasizing—and keep on emphasizing—the things on which you agree. Keep emphasizing, if possible, that
you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.""
-Attitude has inertia, and you create much more convincing work for yourself if you begin in the wrong direction.
-Frame necessary action as being not for your sake, but for the other person's sake. Make the other understand your desires as common between you.
-""He who treads softly goes far."" ~Chinese proverb</li><li>

Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.
-""If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.” ~La Rochefoucauld
-""When our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they—or at least some of them—will feel inferior and envious.""
-If you seek friends, ask others to share their joys with you, and only tell them of yours if asked.</li><li>

Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.
-""No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or told to do a thing. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wishes, our wants, our thoughts.""
-“In every work of genius we recognize our
own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.” ~Ralph Waldo Emerson
-“The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury.” ~Lao Tse</li><li>

Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.
-Ask yourself how your goal can be framed by their desires.
-""I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person—from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives—was likely to answer."" ~Dean Donham, Harvard Business School</li><li>

Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.
-To stop arguments and cultivate in the other both good will and rapt attention, you need only to say ""I don't blame you at all for feeling the way you do. If I were in your situation I'd feel the same way.""
-""Three-fourths of the people you will ever meet are hungering and thirsting for sympathy. Give it to them, and they will love you.""
-Develop in yourself absolute sympathy for idiosyncrasies, even if they do not resemble your own, and people will recognize that you have taken the steps to understand their uniqueness.
-""Sympathy the human species universally craves."" ~Dr. Arthur I. Gates</li><li>

Appeal to the nobler motives.
-J.P. Morgan observed that people usually have two reasons for doing things: a real one and one that sounds good. Carnegie says ""the person himself will think of the real reason. You don’t need to emphasize that. But all of us, being idealists at heart, like to think of motives that sound good. So, in order to change people, appeal to the nobler motives.
-""Nothing will work in all cases—and nothing will work with all people. If you are satisfied with the results you are now getting, why change? If you are not satisfied, why not experiment?""</li><li>

Dramatize your ideas.
-""Merely stating a truth isn't enough. The truth must be made vivid, interesting, dramatic.""
-Showmanship is not a tool of deception, but can often serve to make your idea more tangible and understandable.</li><li>

Throw down a challenge.
-“The way to get things done is to stimulate competition. I do not mean in a sordid, money-getting way, but in the desire to excel.” ~Charles Schwab
-""That is what every successful person loves: the game. The chance for self-expression. The chance to prove his or her worth, to excel, to win.""</li></ol>

<h2>Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment</h2>
<h2>Before you Approach:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person.</li>
<li>Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do.</li>
<li>Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants.</li>
<li>Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest.</li>
<li>Match those benefits to the other person’s wants.</li>
<li>When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit.</li>
</ol>

<h2>During the Approach:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
-If you must criticize, the most effective way to do so is to first show the person what they have been doing well, and to appeal to their desire to do well further.
-Demonstrate that you have confidence in the person and their abilities to solve their problems, and frame their improvement as something they should want too.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.
-Never use the word 'but' between praise and criticism. It will deepen the impact of your criticism by contrast, and call into question the credibility and authenticity of your praise.
-Instead, always opt for the word ""and"" and frame the critique's opposite in a positive and desirable light which supplements your praise.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.
-Put yourself on their level and frame their mistakes in terms of yours, and they will be much more receptive to your criticism as advice rather than attack.
-Give not just constructive criticism but also the tools and guidance with which to construct.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Always frame orders as suggestive questions.
-Give others the pride of choosing to adopt your ideas, rather than the shame of being forced to move against their will.
-A good leader illuminates the ideal path, but makes the follower believe they are choosing it.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Always let the other person save face.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>""I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.” - Antoine de Saint-Exupery</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement.
-""Abilities wither under criticism; they blossom under encouragement.""</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
-""If you want to improve a person in a certain aspect, act as though that particular trait were
already one of his or her outstanding characteristics.""
-""Assume a virtue, if you have it not."" -Shakespeare</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
-Work diligently alongside the other person to celebrate their progress and egg them on. Make the process sound easy and help make it so.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.
-Also display that it would make you happy - ""I would be very glad if you would...""</li></ol><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><ul>
<li><strong>Things that don’t work</strong>
<ul>
<li>Obvious, unfun or uninteresting questions - meet soon? know what to do?</li>

q3,]Y&*CQI	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	Child Development - Sensitive Period	"Montessori theory - moment when a child's inclination/focus toward a certain kind of learning is heightened<br><br>""During their first six years of life, children move through five main 
categories of sensitive periods, including: order, language, sensory 
skills, movement, and social skills. Each sensitive period lasts for as 
long as it is necessary for a child to complete a particular stage in 
their development. These periods of special sensitivity are only 
temporary and fade once the aim is accomplished.<br><br>Other characteristics of sensitive periods may include mimicking, 
intense concentration, and compulsive or obsessive behaviours. 
Interrupting a child while they are in the middle of an intense 
sensitive period can result in a powerful emotional response such as a 
tantrum. Break a routine that a child is attempting to understand and 
master, such as getting dressed, bath time or bedtime, and some children
 will emotionally fall apart.""<br><br><ol><li><b>Order -&nbsp;</b></li><ol><li>The sensitive period for order begins at birth, peaks in the second year
 of development, and continues through to around age five.During this period of sensitivity, children may be more interested in 
putting things in order and packing things away, than they are in 
playing with their toys.&nbsp;</li><li>To support the sensitive period for order, it 
is important to establish ground rules, a solid routine, and create an 
organised environment where everything has a place.</li></ol><li><b>Language -&nbsp;</b></li><ol><li>From birth to age six, children are in the sensitive period for 
language. Sensitivity to language involves three key phases: spoken 
language, written language, and reading. The sensitive period for spoken
 language is from 7 months to 3 years of age. It begins when the child 
first creates sounds by mimicking mouth movements, and progresses over 
time, as they learn to form words and simple sentences.</li><li>The sensitive period for learning to write is from 3.5 to 4.5 years 
of age. This begins when the child learns the alphabet, and then sight 
words, which form the foundation for reading and writing skills.</li><li>For reading, a child is intensely interested from 4.5 to 5.5 years of
 age. Reading skills are often developed after a child learns to write 
as it involves visual tracking skills.</li></ol><li><b>Sensory Skills</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</li><ol><li>The first phase of sensory awareness, sensitivity to small objects, 
occurs from one to three years of age. This period can be characterised 
by a child’s fixation with small objects and tiny details.</li><li>The second sensitivity phase, sensorial exploration and classification, 
occurs from 2.5 to 6 years. This phase can be classified by an intense 
desire to take part in learning experiences that integrate the senses.</li></ol><li><b>Movement</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</li><ol><li>From birth to 2.5 years, children are sensitive to gross and fine motor 
development. This begins when the infant child learns to crawl, pull up,
 and eventually walk without assistance.</li><li>From 2.5 to 4.5 years of age, children enter the sensitive period for 
refinement and coordination of movement. This is when the child begins 
to hold items using both hands, develop the pincer grip, and control and
 coordinate movement.</li></ol><li><b>Social Skills</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</li><ol><li>From 2.5 to 5 years, children learn that they are part of a group and develop an intense interest in social relationships.</li><li>To support the development of social skills in your child, it is 
important to provide your child with opportunities to socialise with 
children their own age i.e. at playgroup or childcare. At home, you can 
model positive social behaviours, and practice grace and courtesy 
rituals such as saying “please” and “thank you.”</li></ol></ol>

<div>Stress means life-threatening behavior, the fight or flight response.</div>
<div>Norepinephrine, Adrenaline, Cortisol</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Stress response:</div>
<div>Heart rate increase, blood drains from prefrontal cortex, blood thickens in case of injury, pupils dilate to let in more data. Digestive and reproductive systems slow. Usually prevents sleep</div>

<div>Four questions:</div>
<ol>
<li>How will your character change if you methodically become a less stressed individual, accomplishing less and pursuing happiness first?</li>
<li>What scares you about having free time and how does your work make you feel “good enough”?</li>

<div>Many people use pacifiers instead of addressing underlying grief, trauma, shame</div>

<div>Stress is the outweighing of our perceived capacity to accomplish by our perceived responsibilities. Also can be understood as the unpredictability between expectations and ultimate reality</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>How to decrease perceived responsibility:</div>
<ol>
<li>Identify and communicate realistic expectations, including saying NO, I WON’T MAKE DEADLINE, etc - everyone’s ultimate goal is to ship product</li>
<li>Ask for help and extra time. Delegate some tasks to others so you don’t suffer an opportunity cost from burnout.</li>
<li>Aim to satisfy. Promise no more than you can deliver; don’t feel pressure to overdeliver on your promises</li>
<li>SHIP CONSTANTLY AND IN PUBLIC SO PEOPLE CAN SEE YOUR RESULTS</li>
<li>clarify your desire to do something from your availability for it</li>
</ol>
<div><br></div>
<div>Our expectations for ourselves lie somewhere between what we perceive and what we perceive others to perceive</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Increase your perceived capacity</div>
<ol>
<li>Optimize physical well being; exercise, sleep, cut caffeine, eat well and consistently, use drugs for non-stress reasons.</li>
<li>Build white space into your calendar, aka stress insurance. Don’t book a bad season ahead just because you’re currently in an available season</li>
<li>Connect with others for casual interaction as much as possible outside the workplace</li>
<li>Self-compassion: hold yourself to reasonable standards and expectations, and give yourself the same kindness/support you would show to someone stressed</li>

<div>Businessmen who preach that businesses should have a ""social conscience"" are preaching ""pure and unadulterated socialism"". Defending philanthropy as a cornerstone of free enterprise makes you an unwitting puppets controlled by intellectual forces which are undermining free society.</div>
<div>It's difficult to assess how well a leader leads, but indisputable that they contractually agreed to do exactly that.</div>
<div>If an individual believes in giving to organizations, those are the social responsibilities of the person, not their company. If social responsibility is not pure rhetoric, we understand that socially responsible companies must by definition do something against the interests of their shareholders. Committing to socially responsible causes means taking money from employers, employees, or customers - which is against the interests of the company. It's essentially taxation without representation.</div>
<div>Public service nullifies your shareholder obligations &amp; demonstrates your priority is being a public servant. If you're a CEO making this decision, you must have good political machinery in place to manage a large transfer. If you're a shareholder, even more so. This is why union leaders object to government market interference much more than business leaders.

<h2>Social responsibility on a company level harms free society by using justice as an aegis for corporate embezzlement.</h2>

The death of ritual processes for initiating boys into manhood; pseudo-initiations or mere ceremonials take their place
""Patriarchy is the expression of the immature masculine.""
""Boys fear women. They also fear real men.""
Death is a vital part of any initiatory ritual.
""Boys who are too bound to the mother get hurt.""
""The 'death' of the hero in the life of a boy (or man) really means that he has finally encountered his limitations. He has met the enemy, and the enemy is himself.""
We access the mature masculine through true humility. True humility consists of two things: knowing our limitations and getting the help we need.</div>
<h2>King</h2>

""This is the clear decision, after careful deliberation, that cuts through the mess in the family, at work, in the nation, in the world.""

<div>""George Herbert Mead's idea of the ""looking-glass self,"" social psychology has assumed that one's self-image derives in large part from how one is viewed by others—family, school, and the broader society. When those views are negative, people may internalize them, resulting in lower self-esteem—or self-hatred, as it has been called.""</div>

<div>""Our research bears a practical message: even though the stereotypes held by the larger society may be difficult to change, it is possible to create niches in which negative stereotypes are not felt to apply. In specific classrooms, within specific programs, even in the climate of entire schools, it is possible to weaken a group's sense of being threatened by negative stereotypes, to allow its members a trust that would otherwise be difficult to sustain.""</div>

I’m bleeding money.” He then coerces other board members to enforce this.</div><div><br></div><div>“The same level of efficiency, cost and quality as our competitors.”</div><div><br></div><div>In response to OSHA singling them out for too-dense factory layouts and too-narrow factory walkways: “a tall tree catches the wind.”</div><div><br></div><div>Honcho: “the most important thing is not how much money we earn, but how this will change the Americans’ views of the Chinese and China. Every Chinese person should do things for our country and our people.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>“American workers are not efficient. I can’t control them. When we try to manage them, they threaten to get help from the union.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>American execs visit Fuyao’s Chinese plant and are astonished to see flawless synchronous paired work, seamless flow of a part between stations, continuous integration along a conveyor belt. Also they are used to constant supervision and required to report constantly. Additionally, they get only one or two days off per month, and work twelve hour shifts. Many have children they rarely see. One woman returns home to see her young child only once a year, at the Spring Festival. Another has a 6-month and two-year old and says he doesn’t get time to take breaks to see them in some years. Some of them are made to pick through piles of broken glass and sort colors for recyclability.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One team’s motto: “To stand still is to move back.”</div><div><br></div><div>Chinese workers are all unionized, but the Union leader is also the secretary to the Fuyao communist party committee, and the brother-in-law to the chairman.</div><div><br></div><div>In a display case they have China’s five leaders since it was established: Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zenón, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping. They say the government heavily supports Fuyao, and workers support the company because they are like rowers in a boat: if the boat sinks, everyone loses their jobs.</div><div><br></div><div>They have an insane cross-cultural celebration with extravagant propaganda songs about manufacturing efficiency from a range of kids and teens, plus YMCA dance for American execs, plus a group wedding for employees (complete with wedding ball).</div><div><br></div><div>For the Chinese workers in the Ohio factory, they have televisions on of Chinese children singing and praying all day.</div><div><br></div><div>After American workers protest over 11+ workplace accidents since establishment, Chinese workers are called together for another security briefing about why unionization is disastrous. From January to October the company has lost $40mil. The company fires both its American presidents and hires a new Chinese president, who has spent 27 years in the US and 26 years in China. He cites passion and determination with making him look like he is in his 40s, when in reality he is 53.</div><div><br></div><div>Older American employees adore their Chinese coworkers because most American companies won’t even hire them due to ageism.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than try to find resolution, two employees with differing backgrounds will often try to find blame.</div><div><br></div><div>

<div><b>Cultural sensitivity training 2, later on:</b></div>
<div>“there’s a culture in the US where children are showered with encouragement, so everyone who grows up in the US is overconfident. Americans love being flattered to death. you will get into trouble if you fight with them. Donkeys like being touched in the direction their hair grows. Otherwise they’ll kick you. We need to use our wisdom to guide them and help them, because we are better than them.”</div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Two private table discussions occur:</b></div><div>American complaints about the Chinese:</div><div>They’re in the factory practically 24/7 and use this moral superiority to berate Americans during working hours, while offering very little actual help. They refuse to explain orders when asked why. They refuse to show respect. At least 3000 Americans have come and gone by a year in, after being fired or quitting. All American bosses are demoted. China enforced their control culturally and politically. Their workers poured chemicals into sewers and off of docks at the company.</div><div><br></div><div>Chinese complaints about America:</div><div>Chinese workers lament that you can’t force Americans to work overtime, or even announce overtime at a company level, when in China overtime is mandatory. Some argue Saturdays should be required.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One chinese worker says he is impressed Americans can work two jobs, one at the factory and one outside. He says he always thought Americans lived a comfortable and superior life. He thought they didn’t have to make any sacrifices.</div><div><br></div><div><b>At The union meeting:</b></div><div>An American worker’s daughter who does nails for a living made 40k last year (2017), while the Fuyao worker made 27k. Someone’s coworker was fired for taking a week off because they were hospitalized and didn’t report. Work continued around active fires in the factory. Dayton taxpayers pay tens of millions to Fuyao, but Fuyao has not provided for the community.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One speaker: “We rejected 70 years ago that rich people get to pick and choose what happens to you. Nothing in America has changed in terms of working people working hard. That’s not what changed. What changed his people at the top deciding they want to rewrite the rules to take advantage of people. To make it in their favor at your expense. You have a right to say no to that, that’s what you need housing at three hours all about. We found a way to for companies to make money and still pay employees, for employees to be safe.”</div><div><br></div><div>In response, Fuyao hosts a meeting announcing a $2/hr raise for all factory floor emploueees. In exchange, they ask employees “work harder, work longer, to match our factory in China.”</div><div><br></div><div>The American workers succeed in unionizing. Some refuse to join them and are rewarded internally. “All the union’s gonna do is keep the bad workers. And the good workers, it’s just gonna go along like it is for us.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A secretly recorded Fuyao presentation:</div><div>“ You can’t get fired for going on strike, but you can get permanently replaced.“ tons of unionized workers get fired.</div><div><br></div><div>In response to “things are different here in America “, Fuyao, head honcho: “well, we’ve already invested here.“ Fuyao calls the United Auto Workers’ union “corrupted”.</div><div><br></div><div>“One mountain cannot hold two tigers.”</div><div><br></div><div>In the end, in the vote to unionize, Chinese workers won 60%: 868 No, 444 yes. They say the scare-tactic trainings likely worked, along with the firing of leadership, the hiring of young and impressionable employees.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Chinese president takes a moment to grandstand, “our best ten workers will be sent to China. This is Shanghai, the most modern city in China. Looks like Manhattan, right? This is Manhattan two.” Goes on to talk about hotels with sky pools, who is the best employee, etc. ends with “we need to create success forever. let’s make America great again.”</div><div><br></div><div>After Fuyao boss waxes sentimental about the quietness and simplicity of his rural childhood, he laments his possible contribution to environmental destruction and his never ending work. In the end, he says “ I only think that way when I am unhappy. The point of life is to work.”</div><div><br></div><div>One worker was fired after 2.5 years for being too slow to pull something up on a computer. 2-3 minutes.</div><div><br></div><div>One Chinese worker: “ in the old days. All Chinese people wanted in life was to have food and to raise their kids. When it comes to my generation, we want it all. We travel wherever we want and buy whatever we like.“</div><div><br></div><div>The movie estimates ~400m people will need to change jobs by 2030 because of automation</div><div><br></div><div>The company now employs 2200 American and 200 Chinese workers, making a profit every year after 2018</div>"	documentary economics futurology movie politics sociology

u*:|V5T6gg	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	Case Interview Secrets	"<div>Case interview secrets</div>
<ul>
<li>Out of 400 Stanford applicants, McKinsey accepted 6, a 1.5% admission rate</li>
<li>Seven parts: process overview, quantitative assessments, real-world fundamentals, problem-solving frameworks, candidate-led interview, other formats, pulling skills together</li>
<li>Seven types of evaluation formats in two categories:</li>
<ul>
<li>Hypothetical-situation case interview</li>
<ul>
<li>Candidate-led case interview:&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>extremely general starting prompt e.g. should we enter XY market; how do we stop losing money</li>
<li>Silence from interviewer for rest of interview</li>
<li>YOU decide what questions to ask</li>
</ul>
<li>Interviewer-led case interview (McKinsey exclusively uses)</li>
<ul>
<li>Interviewer decides what’s important, asks you specific questions</li>
<li>Lots of jumping around in topic, which can be jarring</li>
</ul>
<li>Written case interview</li>
<ul>
<li>Somewhere between 5 and 40 charts, with an hour or two to review all information</li>
<li>Written test administered after this time</li>
</ul>
<li>Group case interview - typically a 4-person group will get several exhibits and an open ended question. You score points by helping colleagues, not sabotage</li>
<li>Presentation-only interview - overlap with written, often paired, lots of exhibits to choose from, pure polish gets you the position</li>
</ul>
<li>Quantitative assessments</li>
<ul>
<li>Many include a mini-case</li>
<li>The quantitative test- McKinsey PST</li>
<ul>
<li>No business knowledge required</li>
<li>Read questions literally and carefully; only answer the question asked, with the data presented</li>
<li>for math - Arithmetic, fractions, percentage calculations</li>
<li>data interpretation - chart analysis &amp; which of four conclusions is NOT supported</li>
<li>numerical critical reasoning - based on the date, which strategy is advantageous?</li>
<li>Take sample tests; practice fundamental skills e.g. math word problems</li>
<li>Find GRE question sets</li>
<li>The above is 70% of the PST, quantitative speed and accuracy, large number estimation</li>
</ul>
<li>The estimation question - use assumptions to solve pen-and-paper math problems</li>
<ul>
<li>Typically, estimate the size of a particular market</li>
<ul>
<li>How many gallons does a gas station pump each week?</li>
<li>How long to relocate an average mountain with an average dump truck?</li>
</ul>
<li>Make a few assumptions where needed, and do the math</li>
<li>Assess HOW you solve problems rather than how accurately</li>
<li>Common format: determine whether an opportunity is worth considering by evaluating whether estimated financial impact is even remotely close to minimum expected financial return. This can eliminate 80% of opportunities</li>
<li>Assess best and worst case scenario customer impact, product price impact, revenue impact</li>
<li>You are hired to end three-year debates between executives in ten minutes of calculation</li>
<ul>
<li>Clients value a consultant’s ability to resolve debates of opinion using estimates based on reasonable assumptions</li>
<li>Consulting firms value people with stellar client service</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill #1: precise arithmetic with large numbers</li>
<ul>
<li>Market size * market share * revenue per buyer</li>
<li>Order of operations: big even numbers first, split complex problems into multiple simple problems, do percentages and fractions last</li>
<li>“A long series of simple math problems rather than a short series of complicated ones”</li>
<li>Arrange before you ever compute</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill 2: rounding numbers intelligently</li>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes quick, directionally correct answers are much better than slow precise ones</li>
<li>Remember whether estimation makes your final answer low or high, and counterweight for that in results and subsequent calculations</li>
<li>Alternate rounding up and rounding down, use physical hand signals to help you remember weighting bias discreetly if needed</li>
<li>Most consultants typically consider +-20% margin of error acceptable on large estimation</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill #3: finding a proxy</li>
<ul>
<li>Substitute product whose market behavior is similar to a product in question</li>
<li>Population size is usually a good proxy for market size, but not always</li>
<li>How many liters of gas does a filling station pump per week?</li>
<ul>
<li>Number of pumps a station has</li>
<li>Number of cars that drive by</li>
<li>Average percentage of pumps in use</li>
<li>Average volume of gas pumped per car</li>
</ul>
<li>It’s 1980 and Motorola has just released a failing product called the cellular phone. As costs and prices decline, what will sales be in 1985?&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Proxy is other young tech markets like fax machines, microwaves, TVs on their first three years</li>
<li>How much did a price drop of 30% affect these technologies once they had broken out of their torturous and expensive first few years?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Skill #4: identifying how your proxy is imperfect</li>
<ul>
<li>Identify if something is closer to an upper limit than a precise estimate</li>
<li>In the gas pump example, know that customers will be highest during rush hours and calculate for those rush hours rather than for 24/7 pumping</li>
<li>Rule out certain proxies based on their correlation to the desired value</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill #5: segment estimates to minimize proxy imperfections</li>
<ul>
<li>Split a vague estimate into multiple precise estimates: the rate at which a gas pump is used should be split into peak, average, and trough hours. The total gallons pumped on a weekday is the sum of these things</li>
</ul>
<li>Skill #6: solving sub-estimates via assumptions, or guesstimating&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Peak hours gallons pumped = # pumps * # % pumps utilized * # cars filled per hour * # gallons per car</li>
<li>Guess that a station has 8 pumps,&nbsp;</li>
<li>Guess 80% in use at peak hours</li>
<li>Guess 6-minutes fill, I.e. a pump can fill ten cars per hour</li>
<li>Guess 10gal gas tanks because many are not completely empty when filled</li>
<li>So find gallons per hour and multiply by number of peak hours</li>
<li>Use peak hours as a proxy for off-peak hours by halving cars present, then multiplying that halved gallons-per-hour by the number of off-peak hours</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Why case interviews exist</li>
<ul>
<li>What a firm does changes yearly &amp; often changes from one interviewer to another</li>
<li>The interview stimulates the job, designed to find good consultants. If you hate the interview, you’ll hate the job</li>
<li>You answer more estimation questions as a consultant than as a candidate</li>
<li>All yourself what you would feel comfortable delivering to a client when your firm’s reputation is on the line</li>
<li>The first stage of proving value is most important for a client, as they try to justify the extra expense for relatively less experienced advisors</li>
<ul>
<li>Ask thought-provoking, insightful, unconsidered questions</li>
<li>Analyze data to discover unforeseen, counterintuitive insights that lead to new decisions</li>
</ul>
<li>Often clients will actively look to discredit you, so avoid the two cardinal sins:</li>
<ul>
<li>Offending a client representative at any level by being rude, arrogant or dismissive</li>
<li>Stating a conclusion you can’t support with data</li>
</ul>
<li>Need analytic interpersonal intelligence</li>
<ul>
<li>Clients interpret nervousness as a lack of conviction in your proposed solution, which is why answering a case perfectly but nervously will get you rejected</li>
<li>You’re often getting graded on how the message is delivered, not the content of the message itself</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>What interviewers look for and why</li>
<ul>
<li>Interviewer look for candidates who seem like colleagues already; act your wage</li>
<li>Sell the interviewer on you; switch the tone from evaluative to collaborative</li>
<li>Consultants and clientele are constantly under tension about who’s screwing who</li>
<li>Team size and constraints are determined by the client, not the consultancy firm</li>
<li>New clients often instill a huge pressure to overdeliver</li>
<li>Each client project has its own profit &amp; loss statement, so each consultant has two billing rates: one hourly/daily rate for the consultants contribution to the client, and one for their cost to the firm, e.g. salary, rent, electricity etc</li>
<ul>
<li>These rates are rarely published, but sent to track whether a client engagement is profitable for the firm</li>
<li>Goal is always high-quality work at low cost &amp; maximum profit</li>
<li>Onboarding for new hires often offsets their value it turns them negative</li>
<li>Firms force engagement teams to take on first-year consultants by waiving that persons “cost” to the team P&amp;L</li>
</ul>
<li>Value of an independent problem-solver&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Extreme tests are often used to gauge new hires’ aptitude for independence and problem-solving</li>
<li>Author was asked to generate $200m new profit in 3-5 years, no other guidance</li>
<li>You need to solve the problem competently and make the firm look good</li>
<li>“Will my current work get easier or harder if you’re on my team?”</li>
<li>Independent problem solvers hiring more of the same</li>
</ul>
<li>“What KEY info is needed to answer the client’s question?”</li>
<ul>
<li>Easy weed out question, ends many interviews</li>
<li>Clients mainly ask yes/no or “what should we do?” Questions, eg</li>
<ul>
<li>Should we merge/close division/enter market segment</li>
<li>There’s XY conflict emerging now. What do we do?</li>
<li>Often selling directional yes/no answers, even with vague questions</li>
</ul>
<li>They often want a fast and simple answer to a complex question, not a complex and precise answer</li>
<ul>
<li>This is why interviewers screen out candidates who can’t get comfortable with being “accurate enough” - “precisely accurate” is a negative</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Often right but never without factual justification</li>
<ul>
<li>Sell confidence in not knowing the right answer, if you have to. Sell confidence in suspecting something true if you have to. Caveat your skepticism and sell confidence in your skepticism.</li>
<li>“I don’t have the facts to be 100% certain”</li>
<li>You speak your firm’s POV; sell it well</li>
<li>A client only hears your firm’s opinion, not yours&nbsp;</li>
<li>The biggest nightmare is that a new hire will embarrass the firm</li>
<li>Interviewers nitpick because clients do</li>
<li>Be prepared to defend every possible situation to substantiate a course of action. You must demonstrate that your advice will ALWAYS hold, no matter what issues the interviewer/client brings up</li>
<li>2 ways to get too often right but never without justification:</li>
<ul>
<li>Gather more factual evidence for your argument</li>
<li>Soften your arguments language to leverage already gathered knowledge</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Being correct diplomatically and client-friendly</li>
<ul>
<li>Clients do not accept factually accurate recommendations, they accept factually supported recommendations they can UNDERSTAND</li>
<li>communication just as important as problem solving</li>
<li>Think and communicate linearly, and draw through lines from A to C at the end of your argument</li>
<li>“The right answer is pointless unless the client can understand the process undertaken to get there.”</li>
<li>Senior clients may not even tell you they’re confused until your proposal gets fully struck down because they want to save face</li>
<li>Communication skills separate the final interview rounds from the job offer</li>
</ul>
<li>The airplane test, or don’t be a dick&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>You’re an outsider by default - sometimes an unwanted, distrusted one. Tough clients hope you will prove them right that you’re terrible</li>
<li>Adapt to your clients’ speed of life and work</li>
<li>Your relationship with your recruiter is your relationship with a client</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Process excellence </b>- when a candidate can consistently follow a problem-solving process. You satisfy both needs:</li>
<ul>
<li>You can follow a structured, analytical process</li>
<li>You can reach the correct conclusions from that process</li>
<li>The first point here is much more important- consistent protocol over correctness in allotted time</li>
<li>Multiple case interviews weed out candidates who get lucky in their accuracy and seeks process-oriented hires</li>
<li>Incomplete answers from excellent processes are permissible; you will eventually ALWAYS get the right answer</li>
<li>Easier to coach someone to solve problems faster than coach them to be more consistently accurate</li>
<li>Interviewer considers what it will be like to manage you</li>
</ul>
<li>CEO-level communication skills</li>
<ul>
<li>Optimize your advice from a high-level executive perspective and don’t waste clients’ time with employee-level details</li>
<li>However, understanding employee-level details is essential to understanding what’s wrong with a company</li>
<li>Integrate micro-recommendations into a big-picture strategy and support those recommendations with factual analysis, instilling confidence in the client</li>
<li>CLARITY and CONFIDENCE make corporate action much more likely, and advice much more valuable</li>
<li>SYNTHESIS is central to recommendation because it provides context: do X because it will have Y effect on Z. Connect the dots and ramifications, and synthesize what will happen if the client follows, or ignores, the recommendations</li>
<li>Synthesis also entails high polish and appropriate detail</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><b>Core problem-solving tools - scientific method/ iterative cycle</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>Hypothesis</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Give instant hypothesis before you start to analyze, then revise that hypothesis as you discover more</li>
<li>If profit is down XY amount, examine profit components ie sales, expenses and costs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Intended to reduce the range of possible conclusions, not widen the variety</li>
<li>Also intended to allow you to reach SOME conclusion with half the time you need to reach THE conclusion</li>
<li>Introduce between 30 seconds and 5 minutes into case work, asking background details as necessary</li>
<li>Never forget your hypothesis in the first portion - two out of three get caught up clarifying. If you absolutely need more than 5 minutes to hypothesize, state that</li>
<li>A late hypothesis WILL get you rejected; an early hypothesis MIGHT</li>
<li><b>The hypothesis is more important than the framework. The case interview is hypothesis-driven, not framework-driven. Critical thinking over formula recall.</b></li>
</ul>
<li><b>Issue tree/logical framework</b></li>
<ul>
<li>A consultant’s substitute for an experiment</li>
<li>Sets out logical conditions with logical sub-conditions under which the conclusion is certainly correct</li>
<li>Interviewers want to see your ENTIRE problem-solving strategy to front. Cover your main branches, and then begin drill down to structure the logic of each branch</li>
<li>For the common issue of declining profits, the profitability framework divides into two trees:</li>
<ul>
<li>Profit = sales revenue - operating costs</li>
<ul>
<li>Revenue = Price per unit * units sold</li>
<li>Cost = units sold * cost/unit</li>
<ul>
<li>Cost/unit = fixed c/u + variable c/u</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Every issue has an incentive/benefit framework for all involved parties</li>
<li>Weak/strong problem structuring grades are essential to the offer</li>
<ul>
<li>State issue tree early and logically</li>
<li>Don’t omit key conditions</li>
</ul>
<li><b>VALIDITY TESTING</b></li>
<ul>
<li><b>Top 2 interviewer complaints:</b> mechanical formula-based approaches lacking critical thinking; lacking a hypothesis</li>
<li><b>Hypothesis</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Issue tree formation requires, and is predicated on, hypothesi<b>s</b></li>
</ul>
<li><b>McKinsey MECE test</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive</li>
<li>Categorizes decision-making factors and grades your ability to group information into discrete mutually exclusive categories which cover all possible options (collectively exhaustive)</li>
<li>Discrete categories with no overlap between, which together cover all possible factors</li>
<li>E.g. profits = revenue-cost</li>
<ul>
<li>Cost = fixed cost + total variable cost</li>
<li>TVC = cost/unit * # units manufactured</li>
</ul>
<li>For profit to increase, cost must decrease our revenue must increase. Nothing is overlapped, nothing is left out, all things are presented in categories. MECE approved</li>
<li>Financial vs non-financial factors also work</li>
<li>Internal vs external factors also work</li>
<li>Hypothesis: introducing xyz product makes sense.</li>
<ul>
<li>Favorable customer factors</li>
<li>Favorable competitive environment</li>
<li>Favorable company operations factors</li>
<li>Favorable product-inherent aspects</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><b>Victor Cheng “conclusiveness” test</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Ensure using an issue tree that if all branches turn out to be true, the hypothesis must be true</li>
<li>Every branch must be factually backed and factually fallible; each branch must itself have high conclusiveness</li>
<li>Hypothesis: Apple should introduce the iPad.</li>
<ul>
<li>Customer - future market size <b>huge</b></li>
<li><b>Clients</b></li>
<li>Competition - competitive <b>vacuum</b></li>
<li><b>Products</b></li>
<li>Company - unique product design <b>advantage</b></li>
<li>ROI - potential financial <b>benefit far outweighs</b> R&amp;D costs</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li> <b>Drill-down analysis</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Create logical dead ends either by proving or disproving branches of the tree, and showing those argument elements valid or invalid</li>
<li>You are spending 75% of time on PROBLEM ISOLATION AND DEFINITION, and 25% on PROBLEM SOLVING</li>
<ul>
<li>Never propose a solution until you’ve isolated/defined problem</li>
<li>The solution is just a formality if you’ve defined correctly</li>
<li>If you reach the end of the case without an obvious answer:</li>
<ul>
<li>You set up an incorrect issue tree.</li>
<li>You missed the full depth of a branch or eliminated incorrectly.</li>
<li>The interviewer gave you a key piece of info which you glossed over without analysis, and missed the ability to eliminate a branch.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Process of logical elimination by order of relevance, validity, and soundness under the hypothesis</li>
<li>Revise hypothesis instantly if you discover inconsistency; this is why this stage exists.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>State EVERYTHING aloud in your thought process: “</b>My hypothesis is that the profitability issue is caused by a revenue decline, not a cost increase. I’d like to start by analyzing the revenue side and circle back to the cost side if necessary”.<b> </b>“Hmm, this new evidence casts some doubt on my original hypothesis.”</li>
<li>Not stating logical conflicts = Not understanding conflicts in the interviewers eyes&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Start with the most uncertain branch, or the most central to your hypothesis which could most easily prove/disprove it.</b></li>
<li><b>Use a 70-30 ratio of quantitative-to-qualitative analysis.</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Quantify EVERY branch by asking for pricing, unit sales, cost data going back several years. Ask for competitor data as well. Verify any qualitative claims made.</li>
<li>If costs have increased AND revenue has declined, measure percentage of profit decline attributable to each. You may uncover a 75-25 split between revenue and cost issues.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Quantitative helps answer WHAT is causing a business symptom and by HOW MUCH.</li>
<li>qualitative helps determine WHY a certain decision was made by a client, and HOW process decisions are made.</li>
<li>YOU’RE ALLOWED TO ASK BASIC WHY QUESTIONS</li>
<ul>
<li>What percentage of profit decline came from a drop in sales?</li>
<li>Why have transportation costs gone up for the client but not for the rest of the industry? How is the transportation process different for the client, and why?</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><b>Don’t stop branch analysis until you reach a sub-conclusion</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Stopping point determined by 70% hard data and 30% judgement.</li>
<li>Find the minimally necessary data to support hypothesis</li>
<ul>
<li>No need to know whether a market segment is shrinking by 5% yearly or 20% yearly</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Use diagrams to take notes</li>
<ul>
<li>Don’t list, mind map instead. Two different sets of paper:</li>
<li>one focuses on case structure &amp; should be kept ultra neat. Exclusively tree diagrams and hypotheses. Even if you’re interrupted, this is your road map for you/interviewer to determine where you are.</li>
<ul>
<li>Graphically eliminate or verify branches here for the interviewer. One branch will visually remain at the end: The root of the problem.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>Two is a scratch pad and notes. Use this to determine whether you can eliminate a branch mathematically. This way, calculations can take pages but the roadmap will remain static. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Visible issue is often a symptom of an underlying problem, but you can’t just tell clients they’re wrong. You need severe justification beyond reasonable doubt.</li>
<li>Don’t just tell the answer; lead your listener to it logically</li>
</ul>
<li>Hypothesis: Apple should introduce the iPad.</li>
<ul>
<li>Customer - future market size <b>huge</b></li>
<ul>

<li>ROI - potential financial <b>benefit far outweighs</b> R&amp;D costs</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Hypothesis: Client should enter the XYZ market.</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Consumer demand is strong, growing, and likely to remain growing.</li>
<ul>
<li>If after assessment the market is wavering, eliminate this branch.</li>
</ul>
<li>Client has a strong &amp; sustainable competitive advantage in XYZ market.</li>
<ul>
<li>Understand four key areas here:&nbsp;</li>
<ul>
<li>Customers(Who? Where? What demand? What do competitors know?)</li>
<li>Products (What offerings? How do they compete?)</li>
<li>Clients (What’s unique or unusual compared to competitors?)</li>
<li>Competition (Do competitors differentiate and how?)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Competition in the market is modest &amp; can be beaten with modest effort</li>
<li>If a branch proves correct and consistent, continue. If not, reassess tree and hypothesis wholesale. If needed, narrow the hypothesis: “Client should enter the ABC (growing) segment of the XYZ market.”</li>
<ul>
<li>No single branch of the tree could lead you to this conclusion; you must factor multiple lines of logic</li>
<li>One market segment is growing and attractive.</li>
<ul>
<li>easy to prove/disprove with data</li>
</ul>
<li>Client has at least a modest competitive advantage here which has strengthened and will continue</li>
<ul>
<li>Tough to prove/disprove - Why is the segment growing? Is growth driven by certain customers/regions/product categories?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<li>competition in this segment is weak or modest</li>

yBj;ItBKR$	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	Modeling	"<div>The most common question on here seems to be how to get started so here's a post about everything you need to know, sorry if I missed anything.</div>
<div><b>How do I get an agency/how do I get scouted?</b></div>
<div>There are many ways to get scouted, it could be on the street or it could be by using an agencies social media scouting tags. For example, IMG scouts on social media using the hashtag (#WLYG &amp; #weloveyourgenes) you can also tag the accounts @/weloveyourgenes &amp; @/imgmodels on the posts.</div>
<div>Many agencies have this method of scouting online and you can go to their website to see if they offer it. If you get scouted this way make sure it is by the verified accounts, if you're unsure if it's a trusted account get in contact with the main page to ask. In most cases the agency will ask to see more photos/videos of you then ask for a zoom meeting (or in person if you are in the city you're applying to) the offer a contract if they like you. Don't be afraid to ask questions and have someone look over it for you before signing.</div>
<div>The most common method would be to apply to an agency through there website. You don't need professional photos for this, just follow the guidelines on the website and take them on a phone or digital camera. Do not wear makeup and pick an outfit that shows your figure. Skinny jeans and a tank top is always a good choice.</div>
<div>Finding a trust worthy agency is key. I recommend looking on models.com to find a reliable agency. They have agencies ranked from premium to basic, as well as what country/city they are located in. Many agencies take models from all over so don't be scared to apply if you do not live in the same place you are applying to. If there are no agencies near you, there is always the option to apply to a small boutique agency near you.</div>
<div><a href=""https://models.com/agencies/modeling/All/All"">https://models.com/agencies/modeling/All/All</a></div>
<div><b>What's a mother agency</b></div>
<div>A mother agency generally refers to the first agency you sign with. The goal of mother agencies is to help you develop as a model. They usually help get you scouted in different markets or bigger agencies. However, it all depends on your contract. If you have an exclusive contract with your mother agency you are usually not allowed to sign with other agencies in different markets. If you have a non-exclusive contract you are free to sign with other agencies on your own.</div>
<div><b>What do I pay to an agency</b></div>
<div>A trustworthy agency will never make you pay anything upfront, and many that do ask you to pay are scams. However, most agencies do take a commission fee out of your jobs, this can be anywhere from 0-30% (20% is most common). A lot of agencies do charge for website fees but this is usually under $100. Things such as hotels, flights, and model apartments also come from your paycheck. Comp cards are usually $1 and there are digital versions you can present. Test shoots can be free or they can cost money, it depends on who you're photographer is and your agent should always check with you beforehand if it's ok to spend money. Paychecks are not upfront and tend to be given months after a job; most agencies offer cash advances but this usually has a small interest rate.</div>
<div><b>Commercial vs High Fashion modeling</b></div>
<div>Anyone can be a commercial model, there are no standards. The work included in this type of modeling includes ecommerce, catalogues, tv ads, fit modeling, etc. It does not included runway work and editorials are rare. However, commercial modeling tends to pay much better than high fashion work.</div>
<div>High fashion modeling includes editorials, runway, etc. High fashion has very strict standards; models are expected to be 5'9+ and have measurements no larger than 36-25-36. The pay for high fashion modeling is usually not very high and a lot of work gets paid through exposure.</div>
<div><b>Model Apartments</b></div>
<div>Model apartments are what they sound like. Apartments with multiple models living in them at a time. Most model apartments have bunk beds for all the models living there. They are not free and usually cost anywhere from $20-$70 a night. Generally this comes from your paycheck and model apartments tend to get a lot of models in debt to their agency. If possible try to find an apartment and room with other models, it is cheaper and cleaner that way.</div>
<div><b>Social Media</b></div>
<div>You do not need social media to become a model but it is looked at by both agencies and clients. A agency may sign a model with more followers and a client may pick a model with a higher amount of followers. Your social media should generally have at least some of the work you've done on there.</div>
<div><b>Casting Calls</b></div>
<div>This is basically an ""audition"", bring your comp card and show up early. Wear little to no makeup and once again skinny jeans and a tank is a good outfit.</div>
<div><b>Do I have what it takes?</b></div>
<div>It all depends on the agency and what they are looking for. An agency may pass on you while another may love your look. Focus on getting an agency that truly believes in you over a big agency.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Some good headshots, professional look, athletic and casual looks are usually a necessity.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>This is very true. I was shocked to read somewhere that getting in a mag like Vogue, you could only be paid a few hundred if that. It’s a nepotism/wealthy kids playground but if passionate can be fun. Beauty/commercial does pay better and way funnier shoots too.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Chances are your 9-5 will always make more than modeling plus you get very good benefits. Save at least two years of rent and a bit more. You have to pay for EVERYTHING it's not glamorous. Clients will sometimes pay for hotels and flights but that is rare, usually you pay out of future paychecks. There's also website fees you need to pay. Pay is inconsistent and you can be getting payment for a job months later and jobs aren't consistent. Even when you do get paid the amount is always lower due to commissions and fees that go to your agency. My agency offers cash advances with fees.</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>If you're going to be staying in a model apartment you need to pay for that too. You'll likely be in debt to your agency when starting out. One of the model apartments I was in was $90 a day (roughly $2700 monthly) with each room having 2/3 bunk beds with strict rules. Agencies pay a small fee of like $5000 monthly for the apartment and with multiple girls living there at the same time they are making huge profits. It is not free to stay there, agencies will take your paychecks to pay for the apartments</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Rates can vary and are never based on how much actual work you do. Editorials/Runway rates are bad and commercial/beauty generally pays better. There are also a lot of shoots you get paid nothing in order to build your portfolio or offers where you get paid in exposure</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Modeling is not something you do for money, if you want good money get into influencing and hope you get lucky. Modeling is something you have to put 100% in and even that does not guarantee you'll be successful</div>
<div>Modeling will always be a side job unless you get huge. Best way to do it as a side job though is not to be signed with an agency as they will have you going to castings randomly throughout the week and random times. So it'll be hard to have your primary job and be signed. Freelancing is your best bet. I am signed in NYC and I quickly realized it was nearly impossible to call off for my 9-5 as I could never anticipate when my agent would put me to work.</div>
<div>On that note, check out some modeling apps. I recommend Newbook and Swipecast as I use those primarily whenever I'm not doing agency castings. Obviously they cater a lot towards LA/NYC but you never know.</div>"	behavior career

Gladwell posits that success is a complex concoction of opportunities, cultural legacy, and the time we are born into.

He illustrates this with the ""10,000-Hour Rule,"" suggesting that true expertise in any skill is the result of approximately 10,000 hours of practice, an opportunity that not everyone can access. This rule is exemplified by the Beatles, who performed lengthy gigs in Hamburg, and Bill Gates, who had unique access to a computer at a time when such access was rare.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Movement 2: The Trouble with Geniuses:</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>In his examination of intelligence, Gladwell presents the ""Trouble with Geniuses,"" where he argues that beyond a certain IQ threshold, the predictive value of intelligence on success is limited.

He}=q{b$vn	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	How to Grow Your Career in AI - Andrew Ng handbook for Fourthbrain.ai	"**5-Paragraph Summary**<br><br>**Introduction:**<br>Andrew Ng's guide to career growth in AI emphasizes the transformative power of AI, likening coding for AI to a new form of literacy. He draws parallels between historical literacy and the current trajectory of AI, suggesting that just as reading and writing became fundamental skills for societal advancement, so too will the ability to code and work with AI (Page 4).<br><br>**First Major Movement:**<br>Ng outlines a three-step framework for career growth in AI: learning foundational skills, working on projects, and finding a job. He stresses that learning is a lifelong process, especially in a rapidly evolving field like AI. Foundational skills include understanding machine learning models and core concepts, deep learning, relevant mathematics, and software development. Ng advises that organized courses are often the most efficient way to master these skills (Pages 5-10).<br><br>**Second Major Movement:**<br>The author discusses the importance of scoping successful AI projects. He provides a five-step process for identifying and developing AI solutions to real-world problems. This involves understanding business problems, brainstorming AI solutions, assessing feasibility and value, determining milestones, and budgeting for resources. Ng emphasizes the iterative nature of this process and encourages seeking impactful projects even without deep domain expertise (Pages 14-16).<br><br>**Third Major Movement:**<br>Ng touches on the role of math in AI, suggesting that while a deep understanding of mathematics can be beneficial, especially for debugging and optimizing algorithms, the necessity varies with the maturity of the technology. He encourages learning driven by curiosity and the pursuit of continuous learning to stay abreast of the rapidly changing field (Pages 12-13).<br><br>**Conclusion:**<br>In conclusion, Ng's book provides a comprehensive roadmap for individuals looking to grow their careers in AI. The focus is on continuous learning, practical project experience, and the strategic application of AI to solve meaningful problems. He advocates for a balanced approach to learning technical skills, understanding the math behind AI, and the importance of community and collaboration in this journey (Pages 1-17).<br><br>**10 Bullet Points Highlighting Important Case Studies/Examples:**<br><br>1. **AI as the New Electricity:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ng compares AI's potential impact to that of electricity, suggesting it will permeate and enhance all aspects of human life (Page 2).<br><br>2. **The Pizza Parlor Example:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - A practical illustration of how AI can be applied in everyday life, such as a pizza maker using linear regression to optimize supply chain and staffing (Page 4).<br><br>3. **Career Framework Application:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Ng's framework is applied to AI, with unique challenges such as the need for continuous learning due to the nascent nature of AI technologies (Pages 6-7).<br><br>4. **Importance of Foundational Skills:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Emphasizes the necessity of understanding machine learning models, deep learning, and the relevant math and software development skills (Pages 8-9).<br><br>5. **Learning as a Habit:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Recommends starting small to build the habit of continuous learning, drawing from BJ Fogg's ""Tiny Habits"" methodology (Page 11).<br><br>6. **Math in AI:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Discusses the varying importance of math in AI roles, with an emphasis on understanding algorithms for better decision-making (Page 13).<br><br>7. **Scoping AI Projects:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Provides a step-by-step approach to identifying and developing AI projects that can have a real-world impact (Pages 14-16).<br><br>8. **Iterative Project Development:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Highlights the iterative nature of AI project development, where one must be willing to revisit and revise steps based on new insights (Page 16).<br><br>9. **Educational Approach:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Advocates for structured learning through courses for a coherent understanding over disjointed internet resources (Page 10).<br><br>10. **The Role of Community:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Stresses the importance of building a supportive community for help and collaboration throughout one's AI career journey (Page 7).<br><br>**5 Bottom-Line Pieces of Actionable Advice:**<br><br>1. **Embrace Lifelong Learning:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Successful AI professionals engage in continuous learning to keep up with the evolving field.<br><br>2. **Prioritize Practical Experience:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Hands-on projects are crucial for deepening skills and building a portfolio that demonstrates skill progression.<br><br>3. **Understand Business Implications:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - AI professionals should focus on identifying business problems that AI can solve, not just AI problems in isolation.<br><br>4. **Cultivate Coding Literacy:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Coding, especially in AI-related technologies, is becoming as essential as traditional literacy once was.<br><br>5. **Build a Supportive Network:**<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - A community of peers and mentors is invaluable for support, learning, and navigating the AI career landscape.<br><br>We finished processing the whole document with the PDF Search plugin.

ggQ[4d*;z|	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	🔁Habit, Discipline, Procrastination	"<div>Managing emotions: you need to be able to recognize your negative emotions associated with approaching tasks you tend to procrastinate on, and realize that procrastination is primarily about ""feeling good now"".</div>
<div>Realize that the good feelings you get from accomplishing a task should be used as motivation to continue to work and make progress, not an excuse to celebrate/procrastinate more, e.g. work late for an essay due the next morning, then do nothing about your exam next week after you turn in your essay since you feel good about having accomplished one assignment.</div>
<div>Procrastinators often suffer from lack of identity, don't know what they want to achieve, or why they want to achieve it.</div>
<div>People who are 'social perfectionists' and are motivated to work because of other people's/society's expectations rather than their own sense of accomplishment are more likely to procrastinate.</div>
<div>At a high level, tasks often seem insurmountable since they are so vague. e.g. ""working on my thesis"" or ""studying for my class"" often means doing nothing, whereas ""reading 4 pages of a textbook to understand a concept i need to summarize in my thesis"" is a concrete, broken down goal.</div>
<div>Most important technique introduced at the end 54:11: Be intentional about your implementation. Instead of ""I'll work on my task all day saturday"" (which few people ever do successfully), use the formula: In situation x, I will do y to achieve subgoal z.

<div>Most of the large winners of these competitions immediately sold and created selling pressure since they were already ahead</div>
<div>How do you incentivize smaller developers? With slow drip reward tactics?</div>
<div>Some defi protocols are cross chain and offer token swaps with smaller projects, so those projects get upside and financial interest is aligned</div>
<div>Terra did an avax token swap of $100m worth in order to have buy in with each other. Terra took the deal to put UST on avax network. Everybody gets a piece of everyone’s liquidity Pool, there’s mutually assured destruction, social contract etc. good incentives all around!</div>

<div>You’re extremely unlikely to encounter a classic bargaining situation in real life, and much more likely to encounter a dynamic, intense, uncertain environment, where a hostage taker is in emotional crisis and has no clear demands.</div>
<div>Calm down, establish rapport, gain trust, illicit the verbalization of needs, and persuade the other person of your empathy.</div>
<div>Listening, intensely satisfies, the cheapest the most effective concession and fulfills an essential human need. When individuals listen to, they listen to themselves more carefully and openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings.

<div>Negotiation serves the two distinct vital life functions of information gathering and behavior influence, and includes almost any interaction where each party wants something from the other side. effective negotiation entails, how to size someone up, how to influence their sizing up of you, and how to use these knowledge sets to get what you want.</div>

Let’s not constantly compare our problems to each other and judge our difficulties based on others’ and instead commiserate on the fact that everyone has difficulties. Everyone has hard. There is no harder when it comes to problems in life, only hard.</div>
<div>If you want someone to be real with you, they need to know that you suffer too. Be real and unapologetic with truth. Apologize for what you have done, not for who you are.</div>
<div>The worst thing to tell someone who is depressed or even just sad is</div>
<div>“Life is great! Enjoy it!” or</div>
<div>“You have it pretty good, what are you sad for?” or</div>
<div>“I was sad once, I know what you’re feeling.” or</div>
<div>“If I was able to recover, so can you.”</div>
<div>Nothing about depression is their fault. You know what pain is, but you don’t know how it feels to them. Do not compare your illness to theirs.</div>
<div>Some signs of depression are:</div>
<div>hopelessness</div>
<div>helplessness</div>
<div>social withdrawal</div>
<div>loss of interest in life</div>
<div>Here are some simple things that you can do to help someone who is depressed:</div>
<ul>
<li>Listen to understand.</li>
<li>Do not argue, blame, or tell the person you know how they feel.</li>
<li>Ask how they are feeling</li>
<li>Do not be judgemental</li>
<li>Do not make them feel guilty about the effect it is having on others</li>
<li>Let the person who self-harms know that you want to listen to them and hear how they are feeling when they feel ready and able to talk.</li>
<li>When they do discuss it with you be compassionate and respect what the person is telling you, even though you may not understand or find it difficult to accept what they are doing.</li>
<li>Do not give ultimatums such as 'If you don't stop self-harming you have to move out'. This is not helpful and it won't work.</li>
<li>Understand that it is a long and hard journey to stop self-harming. Be aware that someone will only stop self-harming when they feel ready and able to do so.</li>
<li>Sometimes it is best to confront the depressed. Ask, “Others in similar circumstances have thought about ending their lives. Have you thought about it?”</li>
</ul>
<div>The large majority of teens who self-harm do not do it for attention or with the intent of suicide; most often it acts as a release for stress or a coping mechanism for frustration with the misunderstanding of others or a lack of distinct pain in one’s life. Only 25% of those who self harm want to commit suicide. Don’t tell the person not to do it, you need to respect their right to harm themselves. Present alternatives for coping like mindfulness, sports, or talking to supports, and, if nothing else, make the harm as safe as possible- Make sure they are using clean blades, clean the wound after, etc. Most importantly, be unconditionally supportive and non-judgemental. Be ready to help them decrease the behavior when they feel ready.</div>"	behavior formula persuasion psychology sociology technique

<li>Your credit score or FICO score will improve if you have a higher credit-to-utilization ratio i.e. if you’re using less than your limit. However, credit limits are bumped to increase spending- maintain frugality. Keep your utilization percentage low but above 0. 3:</li>
<li>Make credit card payments more than once a month so that your balance never gets too high.</li>
<li>If you have more than one credit card, another good way you might lower your utilization is to use multiple cards each month. This results in various cards with low credit utilization rather than one with high utilization.</li>
<li>Lastly, you could try to increase your available credit. If your income has increased, if you've maintained an amazing credit history or if you have little debt, it doesn't hurt to ask for a credit limit increase. Just remember that this can sometimes result in a <a href=""http://www.creditkarma.com/article/hard_inquiries_and_soft_inquiries"">hard inquiry</a> on your credit. If you lack excellent credit, you may want to consider opening a <a href=""http://www.creditkarma.com/creditcards/secured_cards"">secured credit card</a> and adding to its security deposit over time.’</li>
<li>You do not have to carry a credit card balance or pay interest every month to show credit card utilization. Even if you <a href=""https://www.creditkarma.com/article/when-should-i-pay-my-credit-cards"">pay your credit card balances</a> in full every month, simply using your card is enough to show activity.</li>
<li>Experts recommend keeping your credit card utilization below 30 percent on each card and collectively. This shows lenders that you know how to spend responsibly and can help your credit score. 1% to 9% is a green light for creditors, 10% to 30% is average but will keep you from the top scores and best rates. 30%+ is not good. However, creditors also care about the total dollar amount of your available credit, so if you have a low credit limit, it usually is not a big deal if your credit card utilization rate is slightly higher than recommended.</li>
<li>Although high credit utilization can be detrimental to credit scores, keeping credit utilization at 0 percent is not recommended either. Creditors want to see people who use their credit, but are able to manage it responsibly.</li></ul>"	career economics finance

IE,p9,8c=Q	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	Jim Simons / Renaissance Technologies	"<div>James Harris Simons founded Renaissance Technologies in 1982, creating what became the most successful quantitative trading firm in history. The firm's flagship Medallion Fund has averaged approximately 66% annual returns (before fees) over multiple decades, significantly outperforming all other investment vehicles.</div>
<div>Key Technical Innovations:</div>
<div>Simons pioneered the use of mathematical and statistical patterns in market data. His key innovation was applying pattern recognition techniques from codebreaking (his previous work at the IDA during the Cold War) to financial markets. The core insight was that market inefficiencies could be identified through advanced statistical analysis of historical price data.</div>
<div>The Technical Framework:</div>
<ol>
<li>Data Collection: Renaissance built one of the largest financial databases in the world, collecting and cleaning tick-by-tick data across multiple markets</li>
<li>Pattern Recognition: They developed algorithms to identify statistical patterns that had predictive power over short time horizons</li>
<li>Execution: High-frequency trading systems were built to capitalize on these patterns before they disappeared</li>
<li>Risk Management: Complex statistical arbitrage strategies were employed to maintain market neutrality</li>
</ol>
<div>Modern Application Principles:</div>
<div>For a software engineer looking to apply these concepts today:</div>
<div>First, focus on data infrastructure. Any successful quantitative strategy requires pristine historical data and reliable real-time feeds. This means building robust data pipelines and validation systems.</div>
<div>Second, understand that simple patterns are likely arbitraged away. Modern strategies require analyzing multiple data sources simultaneously and finding complex interactions. This suggests using advanced machine learning techniques rather than simple statistical measures.</div>
<div>Third, execution speed matters more than ever. Success requires both identifying patterns and acting on them faster than competitors. This means optimization at every level - from algorithm design to network latency.</div>
<div>Fourth, risk management is paramount. Simons' success came not just from identifying opportunities, but from building a portfolio of uncorrelated strategies that could perform well in different market conditions.</div>
<div>Important Caveats:
The specific algorithms used by Renaissance remain proprietary and attempting to reverse engineer them would be speculative. Additionally, the resources required to compete in modern markets are substantial - Renaissance employs over 100 PhDs and has spent decades building their infrastructure.</div>"	career economics finance history
QEqj`H$Fpt	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	"<div><div><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">LinkedIn Learning Course: User Interface Stakeholder Management (2020)</span></div></div>"	"<div><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">**Summary:**</span><br></div><br><div>This course emphasizes the critical role of Design Ops in effectively managing stakeholder expectations and integrating them into the UX process. It begins by establishing that successful stakeholder engagement involves clear communication about deliverables, timelines, and the value UX brings. Key approaches like the Double Diamond and upfront Experience Strategy are highlighted, stressing the importance of research (e.g., Lean Model Canvases, competitive analysis) and data-driven decision-making to align with business goals and user needs. As the instructor states, ""Data is always the key to winning any pushback,"" underscoring the necessity of evidence in guiding product direction and gaining stakeholder buy-in. Collaboration, especially within Agile frameworks, is presented as essential, urging UX to ""jump in and collaborate"" by involving product and engineering in activities like sketching sessions and user interviews.</div><br><div>Effective communication extends to how UX findings and proposals are presented. The course advises tailoring presentations to different audiences (from C-level executives to direct team members), always focusing on user needs, supporting data, and demonstrable measurements of success. ""Make sure the rest is in an appendix, and include all of your facts,"" is a practical tip for executive presentations. Evangelizing UX is a core Design Ops function, involving the establishment of clear processes, creating valuable resources like case studies (""Celebrate your successes. Make sure your stakeholders know why it matters and the impact made""), and fostering a culture where UX is understood and valued. This proactive education helps dispel myths about UX merely ""making things pretty"" and showcases its strategic importance.</div><br><div>Integrating stakeholders deeply into the UX workflow is a recurring theme, positioned as a method to gain consensus and ensure UX has a ""seat at the table."" This involves not just informing but actively involving them in research activities like usability testing note-taking, and workshops for creating user journeys or empathy maps. The course stresses, ""Design is an assumption until validated with real users,"" a mantra to be shared with stakeholders to underscore the importance of research. Educating stakeholders about research methods, their costs, and benefits through formats like ""lunch and learns"" can foster understanding and easier participation. Centralizing research findings and making them accessible is also key for transparency and collective understanding.</div><br><div>Finally, the course delves into the practical application of design thinking and direct stakeholder interaction. It advocates for ""design plans"" and focusing on outcomes over outputs. Key design thinking activities like creating empathy maps, user research plans, Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD), and journey maps are presented as valuable deliverables that should clearly articulate how they address user pain points. Stakeholder interviews are crucial ""before anything else"" to understand perspectives and build trust. The entire process, from ideation and sketching to prototyping and usability testing (""test early and often""), should be collaborative and iterative, with deliverables packaged professionally to reflect the maturity and value of the UX team within the organization.</div><br><div><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">**Key Takeaways &amp; Actionable Advice:**</span></div><br><div>* &nbsp; <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">**Foundational Stakeholder Management &amp; UX Strategy**</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Clearly define and communicate deliverables, including what stakeholders will get and when.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Employ Experience Strategy principles before projects begin, bringing user perspectives alongside business, product, and engineering.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Actionable Advice: ""Do the research create a lean model canvas, et cetera, and present it along with any and all data to back up your findings.""</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Why: Data provides objective evidence to guide product direction and win stakeholder support.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; Actionable Advice: Work within Agile methodologies; ""UX groans and moans about doing demos as an example.

"yU@zIT#oG*"	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	Massage	"<div><strong>How to give a massage:</strong></div>
<ol>
<li>Make the environment relaxing, safe and pleasant. Warm, Clear of debris and distraction. Make the person comfortable before you begin.</li>
<li>Sometimes pain is needed (Like knots), but generally press so you can feel the muscle under the skin without making the person squirm.</li>
<li>Use slow, even, firm strokes with your palms, thumbs, or fingertips. Going fast is uncomfortable. Don’t pinch the person.</li>
<li>Avoid bones/joints, never put pressure on the spine. Also not too much pressure on the muscles over ribs/shoulder blades, or the stomach.</li>
<li>Move toward the heart to promote circulation.</li>
<li>An easy route is Shoulders, Neck, Arms, Hands, Upper back, Lower Back, Hands, Legs, Feet.</li>
<li>Once you start the massage, never leave the person without your touch until you’re done.</li>
<li>Get rid of knots:
<ol>
<li>Overworked muscles get stuck in spasm, resulting in painful knots. Don’t push hard and rub vigorously, but instead start with a full body massage.</li>
<li>Find the lump and rub around it with firm, even pressure. Do long, broad strokes up and down the back using your palms.</li>
<li>With a knuckle or thumb, press down hard on the knot and hold it. Take cues from the person. Have them breathe into it. Hold until you feel the muscle relax, but don’t worry if it doesn’t completely; if it’s stubborn it may take more than one massage to fix.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Shoulders:
<ol>
<li>Grab both shoulders from behind and push down with thumbs.</li>
<li>You can also use forearms:
<ol>
<li>Have the person sit up and press your forearms, palms up, into their shoulders. Use your body weight to press down on your forearm while rotating your thumb in toward the neck.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Also possible is a tennis ball, which can be pressed down and rolled all over.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Lower back:
<ol>
<li>Place a pillow under the person’s hips.</li>
<li>Position one hand on one of the columns of muscle on the lower back. Find with your thumbs the place the rib cage ends. Place your other hand on top of the first hand. Use your body weight to push down slowly, pressing the heels of your palms into the muscle as if to push it away from the spine. Alternately, try one hand on either side of the spine and rock back and forth.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Neck:
<ol>
<li>The person should be on their stomach or sitting up. Place palm on the back of the neck, putting pressure with thumb on one side and fingers on the other. Slowly pull your hand toward the back of the neck while squeezing. Avoid pressure toward the front of the neck.</li>
<li>If you feel a pulse, ease up. Don’t press on the indent behind the ear, as pushing too hard on it can cause nerve damage.</li>
<li>Alternately, create a bowl with your hands for your partner to lie on and press with your fingers at where the flesh meets the skull at the back of the head.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Head
<ol>
<li>Brace thumbs near top or back of head and rotate fingertips in small circles on scalp, moving slowly from forehead to back of head.</li>
<li>Position thumbs at hairline to rub temples and jaw.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Hands
<ol>
<li>Hold their hand in both of yours, with your thumbs on top. Press on the muscles in the palm with your fingers and pull down. Do the same to each finger, but don’t pop the knuckles. Rub the forearms as well.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Feet
<ol>
<li>Take one foot in both hands with thumbs at the ball of the foot. Squeeze and slide your hands up from the bottom. Criss-Cross or circle the thumbs up/down the sole.</li>
<li>For calves, drag your palms and thumbs up from the ankle.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>End
<ol>
<li>Go back to using light, broad, smooth strokes to relax the tissues. And keep being relaxed.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Types of Movements:
<ol>
<li>Begin with softer movements:
<ol>
<li><strong>Effleurage:</strong> Soft and fluid strokes steadily applied with the palm of the hand. It will stretch the soft tissue and is very relaxing. It's a good way to help her body get used to your touch. Always use this technique before and after more energetic rubbing.</li>
<li><strong>The fan stroke:</strong> Your hands should be at either side of the spine above her hips, with your fingers facing her head. Slide your hands up to her shoulder blades with a bit of pressure. Next, move up and out toward the shoulders in a curve, and move back down along the rib cage to your initial position. Basically, you're drawing a coarse heart, which should classify you as quite the romantic.</li>
<li><strong>The circling hands:</strong> Your right hand should be perpendicular to her spine with your fingers pointing to her left. Make counterclockwise semicircular motion with your fingers always pointing in the same direction. Once you've gone a few inches, have your left hand seamlessly take over. And so on. Before long, you will have left-traced an entire circle.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Once her body is accustomed to your attention, you can move on to more vigorous actions:
<ol>
<li><strong>Kneading:</strong> rhythmically squeezing the flesh and muscles for approximately half a minute. Go slowly and don't simply aim for the skin.</li>
<li><strong>Milking:</strong> Similar to kneading, only here you use both hands to grab onto a single muscle group and squeeze, alternating between your right and left hand. Imagine you are milking a cow, hence the name. Then roll the flesh between <a href=""http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip_200/207b_love_tip.html"">your fingers</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Here's a great and fun way to bring this to a close:
<ol>
<li><strong>Fingertips raking:</strong> Arch your hands so that only your fingertips apply pressure to her body, but first make sure that your fingernails aren't potential weapons.</li>
</ol>

pH:WCAOmiE	Basic	Anthro (Psych/Soc/Econ/Health)	GI.biz - State of the Gaming Industry	"<div>THIS IS FROM Q1 2020</div><ul>
<li>What generally turns someone from a non-gamer into a gamer is access to hardware
-Fastest growth in middle East, Africa, emerging economies
-Covid has accelerated games but not changed them
-Stickiest: Console and PC, once invested
-Low barrier to entry? Low barrier to exit.
-Much more investment in home PC setups right now</li>
</ul>
<h2>International App store subgenres by gross revenue &amp; location:</h2>
<ul>
<li>While Google Play app downloads have steadily gown from 5B to 9B downloads in 2016-2019, Apple store downloads have stayed at a plateau
-India generates most mobile revenue - 6B installs in 2019; USA 2nd, Brazil 3rd
-Growth driven by HYPER-CASUAL games
-Chinese people most frequent the top 3 genres for iOS: Role Playing, Action, Strategy
-Same top 3 for Google Play, but role playing has a larger share, market dominated by American &amp; Japanese devices
-More mobile game makers than ever are realizing significant success outside of the top 10.
-Growth difficulties: user tracking &amp; licensing, game removals &amp; content policing
-app stores now enforce Chinese regulations on licensing/content, those are the most restrictive and significantly set the market back
-Q1 2020 is up 21% Quarter-over-Q and 39% YoY. They grew again in Q2. Connect consumers, they say. Revenue had a markedly smaller proportional increase. Projected 35.7% download increase YoY in 2020 to 57Bil
-NOT CLEAR WHETHER MORE USER SPENDING CAN BE MAINTAINED
-As we go further into Quarantine, casual/puzzle/arcade games are dying and simulation/lifestyle games maintain the most increase.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Newzoo Global Games Market Report</h2>
<ul>
<li>In lockdown, players play more DIVERSE games, for LONGER, and STREAM more
-Nets a projected +$2.2Bil positive impact to 2020 forecasts
-Biggest motivation for uptick: filling newfound free time; 2nd: escapism &amp; socialize
-Mobile games had biggest growth (13.3%), lowest barrier to entry, PC cafe closures
-Shooters + Battle Royale have largest growth on PC (4.8%), obviously Animal Crossing.
-Console had revenue/engagement growth (9.3%) with many warning signs
-Warzone, Siege, Minecraft, Spiral Knights align well with Escapism
-iRacing, Twitch, YT Live, Mixer (RIP) poised to replace sports broadcasting
-Valve broke its concurrent users record 4x, with 24.9Mil in the first week of April</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interesting: ""Unlike console, new releases for PC rarely reach revenues that significantly change the market's outlook.""</h2>
<div>Many of the world's gamers play for access, affordability, internet, in a growing middle class. This emergence is much more significant than COVID for the market.
-Just look at the growth slide. High growth, low sticky for cloud/phone gaming (lower barriers to entry, pay-to-win, and lower barriers to exit), decent growth and high stickiness for console/PC (higher buy-in, hobbyists).
COVID accelerated these trends, but didn't change them</div>
<h2>Next-Gen Consoles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Service-oriented Games Businesses like Xbox will innovate, with new game passes, Xbox Live Gold, xCloud
-Will sacrifice sales to better position itself as first-party content launches
-Will risk hardware market share by putting its content on PC &amp; Steam as well
-A serious champion of cross-platform pay</li>
<li>and The product-oriented ones (PS, Nintendo) benefit the most from the status quo. Strong first-party lineups protect them against Microsoft
-More attached to product, both of these companies are resisting cross-platform play.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next???</h2>
<div>Delayed launches for current-gen mean lower software/hardware sales.
Higher console players throughout 2020 boost interest in hardware
Lower consumer spending; less buying of full-price games
Lower console sales on launch and in new year
Lower and lower barriers to entry for other markets</div>"	economics futurology history videogame
