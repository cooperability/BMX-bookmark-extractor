yID/NI(LFQ	Basic	Experiences	Eyes Wide Shut	-for a movie about raucous sex parties, it’s fascinatingly boring<br>-the characters are all completely numb and flat, caught in their own universes<br><br>-there’s none of the scandal, Eros or excitement of affairs - just an endless tunnel of paranoia and jealousy<br><br>-no interesting dialogue or good chemistry whatsoever between protagonist and wife<br><br>-no good sex jokes or funny inuendos <br>	drama movie

This is his legend. Light up the darkness.”<br><br>Dodges the too-long zombie movie trope, but I was still feeling like I wanted more substance - the backdrops, aesthetics, and set pieces are great, but the plotting is so thin and the characters are utterly flat.<br>	movie scifi thriller

kFFA,ykLx7	Basic	Experiences	Gantz:0	Initially tough to stomach, the drawbacks in the human animation were more than made up for by sick monsters. Kind of a dishonored-style tradeoff, but not the one I'd make. If the humans had looked as good, it would have been much more believable and cooler.<br><br>That said, Gantz manga was a while ago and they clearly waited til 2016 for a movie so that they would have animation tech to make this good. It wouldn't have worked in live action, it's like an Alita battle angel type scenario.<br><br>Monsters were scary though, almost totally novel. I really was glad about that admittedly<br><br>I'm producing for SCN next year<br><br>Like many other manga made around that time, its weird attitude around sex had to be turned wayyyyy down for an international/feature/franchise release<br><br>Hilariously, ironically, updating GANTZ for a modern day audience didn't require many changes. I think we may be better suited now than before, but that's for debate.	action anime horror movie scifi

Within each of us is the capacity for total evil - it just takes an opportunity.<br>-The parents of evil are often much greater than the evil itself<br>-It literally just takes exactly one perfectly constructed set, one perfectly constructed villain, and one perfectly constructed prop to make you scared shitless<br>-Damn that was honestly intense as fuck. And I watched it on 1.5x so should have been mad corny. Pretty powerful.<br>-Very compelling composition. The different members of the family are the most terrifying part. You never expect the masked villain to be the least scary in a movie.y<br>-The script is actually pretty great. Very few lines of dialogue go a long way to convey generational trauma, psychopathy, zeal, sadism, sociopathy, innocence, and empathy.<br>-""There are no winks to the audience, and it's better for it"""	horror movie

I=[@L_$/Do	Basic	Experiences	Modern Times - Chaplin	-People can't laugh at things they can't understand, and this was a time when people understood very little. <br>-So Chaplin showed them things they understood (work) in terms they could laugh at (harmless and unproductive machines maintained by hundreds of workers), and things they didn't understand (opulence) in terms they could ridicule (the rich simply waste their time on luxury all day). Chaplin was a lovable character because he was utterly flat - bumbling, tactless, stupid, yet hilarious, charismatic, and often compassionate. <br>-Little communication is required to tell you he's a well-intentioned hero.<br>-We all, in our own way, must go through the meat grinder to gain legitimacy in our society. <br>-Those at the bottom toil over enormous infrastructure which provides frivolities for those at the top.<br>-It's up to us individuals to stop being bystanders and defend each other against. the machines of our world.	comedy history movie

Nothing enjoyable in their lives whatsoever except each other<br><br>How could so many children starve to death in a developed nation? No one will grant them sympathy or food because of desperation. This asks about broken systems, societies without compassion or capability to care for others.<br><br>So little material luxury is required for happiness or even a semblance of normality. But once that fine line is crossed, you’re already starving.<br><br>No work, no school means kids are left to their own devices...together.<br><br>Their aunt really just tells Setsuko her mother is dead.

Foreignness is relative.<br>Vary ur damn music.

Even for kids, you don’t want your audience to constantly disbelieve what you show them.

Especially when everyone’s wearing masks.<br>Lots of staging, alternate angles, costuming, dialogue.<br><br>Good delivery and performances can make a stale, jargon-rich, and inaccessible script bearable. It’s kind of a period piece honestly - perfectly executed 80s ideals-scape of attractive people, cheesy music, bright colors, beaches and cultural excess.<br><br>It’s actually quite full of life despite having dead dialogue and flat characters.&nbsp; 80s magic I guess.<br><br>“I just don’t want anyone to know that I’ve fallen for you.”<br><br>Take My Breath Away by Berlin can do wonders for one of the worst sex scenes I’ve ever seen.	adventure history movie war

The most ""Do-Good"" people are always taken and threatened first.<br>-Any creature feature is shown to test the true character of Americans. They are humiliated, denigrated, and mocked, but they become stronger characters for it.<br>-The greatest humiliation is the loss of identity - specifically, being assimilated. This is antithetical to America, which is why Bodysnatchers and Blob focus on this theme of being drawn into an alien oneness which is unrecognizable to our individualistic society.<br>-In other large ways, it's old vs new. A fledgeling society breaks free of its animalistic, in this case literally primordial roots. Oneness is presented not just as alien, but as a return to somewhere we dare not return: our roots. Precocious children and fearful misanthropes provide the wisdom America needs: run. fear. survive. Evolve or die.<br>-Never seen a creature feature with Black people in it<br><br><br>-When you have no faith left, go further into Americana. Family.

Jones advocates that some sketches not be finished and be interrupted by animation, creating the signature python bathos.</div><div><br></div><div>Cleese hated Jones for the first series of shows, but gained more respect when Jones directed the movies.</div><div><br></div><div>""Most of us are not natural friends...I don't think Terry Gilliam has ever said anything that I agreed with"" - Cleese</div><div><br></div><div>""So few of the critics really have any idea what they're talking about, and of course they have no idea that they have no idea what they're talking about. Oscar Wilde said they are like Eunuchs: They watch it all night but they can't do it themselves."" -Cleese</div><div><br></div><div>""We used to have to get out of the lake at three o'clock in the morning, clean the lake, eat a handful of hot gravel, work 20 hours a day at the mill for tuppence a month, and we'd come home and dad would beat us around the head and neck with a broken bottle IF we were lucky!"" -A Chapman sketch</div><div><br></div><div>Bands loved Python on their farewell tour in 1974, and Led Zeppelin + Pink Floyd were two of the main investors on the Holy Grail.

P4ukVTZ$dB	Basic	Experiences	Paradox of Tolerance - Karl Popper&nbsp;	Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.	prose psychology sociology

<ul>
<li>True Death is in being forgotten, in a classic Spanish way. Each man is unconcerned with leaving a legacy except for selfish purposes. Even Colonel Aureliano admits he is fighting for pride, not justice, and Jose Arcadio Segundo becomes so obsessed with the horrors of the banana massacre that he forgets himself entirely.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<div>“He had had to start thirty-two wars and had had to violate all of his pacts with death and wallow like a hog in the dung heap of glory in order to discover the privileges of simplicity almost forty years late.”</div>
<div>“The secret to a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude.”</div>
<div>The railroad is much like the Gypsies: lifeblood in the form of knowledge, transportation in the form of occultism. Commerce-excused education</div>
<div>“A person doesn’t die when he should but when he can.”</div>
<div>“Watching him putting in latches and repairing clocks, Fernanda wondered whether or not he too might be falling into the vice of building some that he could take apart like Colonel Aureliano Buendía and his little gold fishes, Amaranta and her shroud and her buttons, Jose Arcadia and the parchments, and Ursula and her memories.”</div>
<div>“Both looked back then on the wild revelry, the gaudy wealth, and the unbridled fornication as an annoyance and they lamented that it had cost them so much of their lives to find the paradise of shared solitude.” - Aureliano Segundo and Petra Cotes</div>
<div>“They understood that José Arcadia Buendía was not as crazy as the family said, but that he was the only one who had enough lucidity to sense the truth of the fact that time also stumbled and had accidents and could therefore splinter and leave an eternalized fragment in a room.”</div>
<div>“Before reaching the final line, however, he had already understood that he would never leave that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish deciphering the parchments, and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since time immemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.”</div>"	book fiction history philosophy

FL2U($>?4*	Basic	Experiences	Audre Lorde - The Uses of Anger	"<div>This hatred and our anger are very different. Hatred is the fury of those who do not share our goals, and its object is death and destruction. Anger is a grief of distortions between peers, and its object is change. But our time is getting shorter. We have been raised to view any difference other than sex as a reason for destruction, and for Black women and white women to face each other’s angers without denial or immobility or silence or guilt is in itself a heretical and generative idea. It implies peers meeting upon a common basis to examine difference, and to alter those distortions which history has created around our difference. For it is those distortions which separate us. And we must ask ourselves:  Who profits from all this?</div><div><br></div>
<div>I have no creative use for guilt, yours or my own. Guilt is only another way of avoiding informed action, of buying time out of the pressing need to make clear choices, out of the approaching storm that can feed the earth as well as bend the trees. If I speak to you in anger, at least I have spoken to you: I have not put a gun to your head and shot you down in the street; I have not looked at your bleeding sister’s body and asked, “What did she do to deserve it?” This was the reaction of two white women to Mary Church Terrell’s telling of the lynching of a pregnant Black woman whose baby was then torn from her body. That was in 1921, and Alice Paul had just refused to publicly endorse the enforcement of the Nineteenth Amendment for all women — by refusing to endorse the inclusion of women of Color, although we had worked to help bring about that amendment.</div><div><br></div>

tZed{Bnh3~	Basic	Experiences	Jamie Kirby - Mongol influence on the Nazi Party	"<div>Michael Prawdin’s 1940 book on the Mongol Empire was incredibly influential on Hitler and would be distributed throughout the ranks of the  Nazi party by an excited Himmler.</div>
<div>In contrast to Genghis Khan, Himmler did not support the idea of racial intermingling  and he believed this to be the main cause of the fall of the Mongol Empire. Where the message from Khan was about subjugation and power, Himmler interpreted it to be about racial purity.</div>
<div>They conceived of a new military devoted to its leaders rather than its country. Hitler believed that the collective killing of others would bind his men together on the frontlines, and was careful to keep non-Germans out of the battlefield camaraderie.</div>
<div>Along with the Jews, Hitler aspired to eliminate all mongol bloodlines. He believed they were tough, brutal eastern races of lesser culture that threatened Europe’s development for centuries. He specifically targeted Russians as a threat to Europe -  roughly 70-80% of Russians were of Mongolian descent at the time.</div>
<div>Famous Ernst Nolte: “Bolshevik atrocities — asiatic deeds — may have lead Hitler to devise the Final Solution as a kind of preventative war.”</div>

pqd[fpk6xm	Basic	Experiences	Decentralized Protest - Historian Clayborne Carson	"<div>""One thing that I think everyone would agree on is that the young people who are sparking these protests have no single charismatic, supremely articulate leader. One of the consequences is they don’t control the messaging of it. I think that is one of the weaknesses of Black Lives Matter. There is no established leadership to articulate messages. What is the goal? Is it simply to express anger or is to achieve reform about police behavior? If it is to bring about reform, then what would that look like? It doesn’t have to be one charismatic spokesperson. It could be many leaders, but there needs to be people saying, ‘This is what we want’ and clearly articulating that. That’s just not happening now with any consistency.""</div>
<div>""I think the main component of a peaceful and effective protest is some kind of leadership. Someone who can monitor, someone who can say ‘No, that’s not what we do here.’</div>
<div>But it has to be in conjunction with the police. It takes both sides to make this work. It takes some willingness on the part of demonstrators and the police to exercise restraint. When you have a large group of people who want to peacefully protest, police should facilitate that. You don’t focus your effort on setting up barriers around peaceful protestors and having policemen, with their arms folded, standing in the way. This concentrates police attention on the people least likely to cause trouble and then you don’t have any leftover police to catch looters and vandals elsewhere.""</div>"	infoage persuasion politics revolution

<div>It was higher level than the plaintext internet content networks, but lower level than a fully programmable media platform
Uniform Resource Locators / URLs - uniquely identify resources for retrieval
Hypertext Markup Language / HTML - Assisted by CSS, JS
Hypertext Transfer Protocol / HTTP - resolution + retrieval of hypermedia + HTML docs
-Foundation of www communication between web browsers and web servers
Free distribution &amp; easy deployment of web servers with tech like Apache HTTP server
Free web browser clients like Mosaic, setting up File Transfer Protocol, Network News Transfer Protocol, and the Gopher ecosystem (precursor to HTTP)</div>
<h2>What didn't the web have?</h2>
<div>objectivity
Bi-directional linking
unified user identity between sites
ecommerce
programmable documents (now fixed)</div>
<div>The metaverse is a small set of protocols and software leading to explosive network growth by being layered on the web</div>
<h2>What is the web likely to become?</h2>
<div>Large 3D worlds
Collaborative building, editing, sculpting
Rich games and 3D applications
A global marketplace and ecommerce economy
a home to universal identity
a place to live your ""second life""</div>
<h2>What's needed to achieve those?</h2>
<div>VR devices are now on par with face-to-face interaction for social presence
""As such, we think that the fundamental thing the first metaverse with global reach will enable is that those on the network can instantly experience social presence and shared spatial awareness in a mixed media environment with any other humans on the network.""</div>
<h2>As such, it minimally needs:</h2>
<div>Real time, avatar based communication (voice + body language)
Dynamic mixed media in 3D space
Virtual environments
Addressable places
The ability to join the network independently
Additionally, like the web, it must have:
Free, accessible, easy-to-use tools and software
Neutral, profit-agnostic governance and actors</div>
<h2>The web today can support the metaverse</h2>
<div>Real time, avatar based communication: browser platform (WebRTC/WebGL/WebXR)
Dynamic mixed media in 3D space: browser platform, web content and standards (glTF, video, etc)
Virtual environments: browser platform (WebGL/WebXR)
Addressable places: URLs
Beyond that, the following things are needed:
A free, easy to use tool for creating 3D content and avatars
An easy to use ‘browser’ for participating in mixed media spaces
An easy and cheap to run server to join the network independently</div>
<h2>Here’s what our plan has been from the beginning:</h2>
<div>Create an easy-to-use avatar communication tool for mixed media, globally addressable spaces
Create easy-to-use tools for creating 3D environments and avatars
Build it to run in the browser, and embrace the culture of the web
Open source all the code
Make it cheap and easy for anyone to run their own decentralized server
We have deliberately not included:
Dynamic scripting and rich applications
Large, continuous open world ‘land’
Collaborative editing tools or world building
Transactions or e-commerce</div>

P%9AW@IByP	Basic	Experiences	The Art of War, Sun Tzu	"<div>Five pillars of war:
Moral law, Heaven, Earth, the Commander, and Discipline.
Moral law means accord with the ruler such that people follow them regardless of their everyday.
Heaven is weather, time, season
Earth is where and how you fight, your chances of life and death, how far you go, how much you risk and how likely
Commander is courage, strength, wisdom, sincerity, and strictness
Discipline is the state of your infrastructure and armies, your roads, your maps, your spies, your info</div><div><br></div>
<div>all warfare is based on deception: weak when strong, near when far, moving when still, active when crippled
if he is stronger, evade him. If he tempers, anger him. If he takes ease, give no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Appear where unexpected and attach</div>
<div>Many calculations to victory and few to defeat
weakness in execution means self-sabotage - do not allow your trip to exhaust your men, supplies, strength, until you know it is over.
When others see weakness, they will act on you as you acted on them.</div>
<div>No country benefits from prolonged warfare - only one acquainted with the evils of war can understand the profitable way of carrying it on.
Supply wagons should not be filled more than twice. An army reliant on supplies is starving without delivery. Be prepared to forage on your enemy so that you not impoverish your own people.</div>
<div>In order to kill, troops must anger; in order to kill, they must be rewarded. let those who excelled be rewarded best; use fallen enemies to add to your ranks and show them benevolence.</div>
<div>The leader of armies is the arbiter of peoples' fate - they choose who will live in peace and who in peril.
The best thing of all is to take a country/army whole and intact rather than destroy it. Supreme excellence is in breaking the enemy without fighting. The worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities. It's just too much hassle and too prone to impatience and arrogance.</div>
