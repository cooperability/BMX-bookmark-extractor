K35q<B=U7Q	Basic	CompSci / Math / Logic	Haskell	Functional programming languages put an emphasis on using “pure” functions where possible: functions that always give the same result for the same input. While that is a given for mathematicians, computer programmers are used to the idea that “functions” in a computer program also depend on internal state, data on a disk, or the current time. Separating those “side effects” from the main logic wherever possible, Haskell programmers can make it much easier to reason about their code (“equational reasoning”). Not only does that make it easier to write correct code, it is also invaluable for testing, or even proving its correctness.	blockchain

dO9,!/j[:H	Basic	CompSci / Math / Logic	Arthur Hayes - why Terra nuked	"A Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF) is a cash-settled, usually short-term, forward contract. The notional amount is never exchanged, hence ""non-deliverable"". Two parties take opposite sides of a transaction for a set amount of money - at a contracted rate in the case of a currency NDF. It's a currency bet, but instead of exchanging home and foreign currency cash flows at the start and end of the swap, the difference between the entry and exit exchange rate is paid or received in USD.<br>-Because in the 2010s trading happened over bloomberg chat, with no consolidated spot market, they were prime ground to arbitrage different NDF trading desks.<br>##Why Terra Died<br>1. Anchor offered a 20% yield. This was done by:<br>1. Borrowers paid 10-12% APY depending on their protocol. They were incentivized with ANC as a reward for borrowing, usually around 7%.<br>2. Anchor would stake its collateral funds to receive staking awards.<br>These were not enough to shake off the incredible demand imbalance between borrowers and lenders.<br>3. Anchor also had a reserve, mostly financed by Luna Foundation LFG, which would help cover the difference between 10-12% and 20%<br>4.

<strong>-----------</strong>-----
""VR feels real, and its effects on us resemble the effects of real experiences...a VR experience is often better understood not as a media experience, but as an actual experience.""
Four primary adverse effects of VR:
+Experiential modeling of violence
+Virtual escapism
+Distraction from real world
+Overuse
Brown v. Entertainment merchants association, 2011
Young children are hyper susceptible to accepting false memories</div>
<h2>3 empathic mechanisms:</h2>
<div>+Emotional response to the suffering of others
+Cognitive ability to form theories about how others feel
+Full-fledged - after exposure, do you have a desire to alleviate that person's suffering?</div>
<div>Wearing a black avatar primes more racial stereotypes for white and black participants alike</div>
<h2>Three motives for empathy</h2>
<div>+good deed/positive effect
+Strengthen affiliation with in-group members
+Social desirability - wanting others to see one as a good person</div>
<h2>Three disincentives for empathy</h2>
<ul>
<li>avoid emotional suffering
-avoid incurring material cost (money to help, etc)
-avoid weak performance in social situations</li>
</ul>
<div>Temple Grandin &amp; empathy for livestock</div>
<h2>Into the world of Social VR</h2>
<div>""Virtual reality is going to become a must-have technology when you can simply talk and interact with other people in a virtual space that feels utterly, unspectacularly normal.""</div>
<div>In order to use VR to obviate the need for traveling to meetings, we must achieve perfect verbal and nonverbal synchrony between interlocutors. Nonverbal synchrony has been demonstrated to increase rapport and encourage good, productive conversation.</div>
<div>Philip Rosedale, High Fidelity: what is the virtual handshake?
Chameleon effect: subtle mimicry of another can cause them to like you</div>
<div>Virtual Avatars could decrease FaceTime latency, data use, and make conversations more engaging with instant transfer of the slightest nonverbal cues</div>
<div>Higher need for truth &amp; verifiability in today's media because of reactive reporting plus the power of outlets to manipulate evidence</div>
<h2>VR Journalism</h2>
<div>Nonny de la Peña's work: Placing people not at, but near the Trayvon Martin shooting, since there are no eyewitness accounts
We need regulatory standards for placing real-world violence in VR journalism
Difficulties of VR journalism:
-can't be in your own 360 shot, so it must be static and sitting in one place
-can't ensure that users observe any single detail for ""plant and payoff""
-Low attention span to single objects; no locus of focus
""Claustrophobia is one of the tried and true parlor tricks in VR.""
""Game narratives which allow players to wander generally do not allow for economic storytelling.""</div>
<h2>VR Field Trips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sesame Street had to fight to keep field trips in the ""curriculum"" of included material
-VR is especially effective for at-risk kids who may not be motivated to learn science
-VR is more immersive, but doesn't increase test scores
-Bailenson's solution: Create learning experiences that don't require narrative, or the presentation of facts, at all: ""an active process of discovery""
-Great potential to make a one-on-100 class feel like 100 one-on-one experiences, and thus increase engagement
For teachers who consciously mimic their students' behavior and mannerisms:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The students rarely notice the mimicry.</li>
<li>Students nonetheless are more engaged with mimicking teachers.</li>
<li>Students are more likely to be influenced by, or in agreement with, mimicking teachers.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Good VR Use</h2>
<ol>
<li>Does it NEED to be in VR?
-3 things have always happened when a human has moved:
Optic flow changes
Vestibular system reacts - inner ear, etc
Proprioceptive cues from skin &amp; muscle</li>
<li>Don't make people sick
infinite walking in a circle, simulator sickness etc</li>
<li>Be safe.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Paradigm</h2>
<div>""People's trust in computers may be understood as the extent to which people rely on or have confidence in a computer (computer agent), particularly when they are seeking to achieve a goal in an uncertain or risky situation.""
-""The conditions under which people perceive computers/computer agents as trustworthy closely reflect the conditions under which trust becomes fostered in the context of interpersonal communication.""</div>"	arvr book futurology history nonfiction

<div>""Although it may have its purpose in allowing people to explore realms otherwise inaccessible -- the insides of cells, the surfaces of distant planets, the information web of complex databases -- virtual reality is only a map, not a territory. It excludes desks, offices, other people not wearing goggles and body suits, weather, grass, trees, walks, chance encounters and in general the infinite richness of the universe.

Names like Brazil:</li><li>“A first or last name that is ""too long"" can get truncated in any of the dozen government computers. At that point, it will fail automatic name matching and you go into the manual process where few claims ever come out alive.”
“Alternate ‘Anglicized’ first names are common in some ethnic groups—a real observed example is birth certificate says Graciela, driver's license says Grace. This will fail the automatic match, and the human reviewer will usually reject it too.”
Similarly, there were many examples of Vietnamese names not ""matching"" official records because of spaces between names, nicknames, and/or inconsistency of which portions of the name were shoehorned into first-middle-last name fields.</li><li>Instead of focusing on creating fraud where it doesn’t exist, a state’s mission should be to make systems easy-to-use for eligible applicants and to identify fraud within a greater context of accessibility.

States should offer multiple ways to apply, including options that do not require internet access or a computer
States websites and application processes must be 508 compliant and fully usable for members of the disability community
Websites and applications must be mobile-responsive
Content should be written in plain language and in multiple languages
Processes, documentation, and requirements should be clear and concise
An applicants’ claim status should be clear and appeals should be easy to file
Sites should autosave applications during the process and warn users when a session will end
States should design systems with users and get their feedback through usability testing
It should be easy to speak to a human that can provide clear instructions and help, whether on the phone, in person, or via chat</li><li>Businesses should consider creating work-sharing programs that would allow employers to spread layoffs across their entire workforce instead of laying some people off entirely, while supplementing the remainder of workers’ wages through UI. As companies begin rehiring, they should be incentivized to notify former employees first, giving those workers an opportunity to apply for those jobs while also decreasing training costs for the business, as former employees will be familiar with company operations. State policies, which often benefit employers over employees, could also be modified to better serve workers —notifying them when a former employer has started rehiring. Finally, the federal government should ensure that all states provide unemployment benefits for at least 26 weeks, long enough to cover the average length of unemployment periods for all workers, especially workers of color.</li><li><a href=""https://www.newamerica.org/public-interest-technology/reports/unpacking-inequities-unemployment-insurance/"">https://www.newamerica.org/public-interest-technology/reports/unpacking-inequities-unemployment-insurance/</a></li></ul></div>

This is particularly useful for tasks that are time-consuming or need to be executed at a later time, without making the user wait for the task to complete. Let's break this down into more detail, including the terminology and the roles of Django, synchronous/asynchronous execution, Django workers, and Redis in the context of a job queue.</div><h3>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Execution</h3><ul><li><strong>Synchronous Execution</strong>: The code is executed in sequence, meaning that a task must complete before the next one starts. In a web application, this can lead to blocking I/O operations, making the user wait for the task to complete before the webpage can be updated or responded to.</li><li><strong>Asynchronous Execution</strong>: This allows the program to move on to another task before the previous one has completed. It's beneficial for tasks that are I/O bound or require waiting for external resources. Asynchronous execution can improve the throughput and responsiveness of a web application by not blocking the execution thread with long-running tasks.</li></ul><h3>Django and Asynchronous Tasks</h3><div>Django is a synchronous framework by default, designed to handle HTTP requests and responses in a linear fashion. However, Django can integrate with asynchronous job queues to offload tasks that don't need to be completed within the lifecycle of a single request.</div><h3>Job Queue</h3><div>A job queue is a mechanism for scheduling tasks to be executed asynchronously. Tasks are added to a queue, where they wait to be processed by a worker. The queue ensures tasks are executed in the order they were added or based on priority levels.</div><h3>Django Workers</h3><div>Django workers are processes or threads that run separately from the main application server. Their job is to listen for tasks in the job queue, execute them, and return the results. The workers run outside the request-response cycle, allowing them to handle time-consuming operations without affecting the responsiveness of the web application.</div><h3>Redis</h3><div>Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used as a message broker for Django job queues. It provides a fast and efficient way to implement a job queue because of its support for various data structures like lists, which can be used to manage the queue of tasks. Redis serves as the intermediary between Django and the workers, holding the tasks until a worker is available to process them.</div><h3>Implementing a Job Queue in Django</h3><ol><li><strong>Choose a Task Queue Library</strong>: Libraries like Celery, Django-RQ (Redis Queue), and Huey are popular choices for integrating asynchronous task queues with Django. These libraries allow you to define tasks (functions) that can be executed asynchronously.</li><li><strong>Setup a Message Broker</strong>: The message broker (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ) holds messages (tasks) that are sent from Django until the workers pick them up for execution. Redis is often chosen for its simplicity and performance.</li><li><strong>Define Tasks</strong>: With the chosen library, you'll define tasks that you want to run asynchronously. This involves decorating functions you wish to run in the background.</li><li><strong>Run Workers</strong>: Workers need to be started separately from the Django application. They continuously listen for new tasks added to the queue and execute them.</li><li><strong>Enqueue Tasks</strong>: From your Django application, enqueue tasks to be executed asynchronously.
