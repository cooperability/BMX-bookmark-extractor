# BMX Implementation Plan

## Phased Development Roadmap (Focus on Knowledge Pipeline)

### Phase 1: Neo4j Setup & Initial Anki Ingestion (Weeks 1-3)
**Focus:** Establish Neo4j, define data model for Anki, implement parser and ingestion scripts, basic FastAPI for Neo4j.

**Deliverables:**
- Neo4j service integrated into docker-compose

- Basic graph data model for flashcard content (lightweight nodes with PostgreSQL references)
- FastAPI endpoints for Anki data ingestion
- Initial graph visualization capabilities

### Phase 2: PostgreSQL Integration & Hybrid Storage Strategy (Weeks 4-5)
**Focus:** Implement PostgreSQL (Supabase) for primary data storage, establish hybrid architecture patterns.

**Deliverables:**
- **PostgreSQL service** integrated for primary content storage
- **Hybrid data model**: PostgreSQL stores content, Neo4j stores relationships
- **SQLAlchemy models** for documents, entities, and summaries
- **Reference strategy**: UUID-based linking between databases
- **Event-driven synchronization** between PostgreSQL and Neo4j
- **API endpoints** for both graph traversal and content retrieval

### Phase 3: Web Content Ingestion Pipeline - Foundation (Weeks 6-8)
**Focus:** Develop web scraping, initial non-LLM condensation (SpaCy/NLTK), hybrid storage implementation.

**Deliverables:**
- Web scraping module with robust error handling
- Content extraction and cleaning pipeline

### Phase 6: Production Deployment & Optimization (Ongoing)
**Focus:** Supabase + Neo4j AuraDB deployment, performance optimization.

**Deliverables:**
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** production deployment with real-time features
- **Neo4j AuraDB** integration for managed graph database
- Cross-database consistency monitoring and validation
- Performance optimization for hybrid queries
- User authentication and authorization across both systems
- API rate limiting and usage analytics
- Comprehensive backup and recovery strategies

## Production Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Verification
- [ ] **Environment Parity**: Ensure production environment matches development stack versions (Node.js, Python, database versions)
- [ ] **Dependency Audit**: Run `yarn audit` and `pip audit` to check for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Build Verification**: Confirm both frontend and backend build successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] **Health Check Endpoints**: Implement and test `/health` endpoints for backend services

### Database Configuration
- [ ] **Database Connectivity**: Verify production database connection strings and credentials

- [ ] **API Base URLs**: Update all API endpoints to use production URLs
- [ ] **CORS Configuration**: Configure CORS settings for production domain
- [ ] **SSL/TLS**: Ensure HTTPS is properly configured with valid certificates
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Verify 500 errors return appropriate responses without exposing internals
- [ ] **Logging**: Configure structured logging for production monitoring

### Frontend Deployment
- [ ] **Build Environment**: Ensure production build uses correct environment variables
- [ ] **API Integration**: Verify frontend correctly calls production API endpoints
- [ ] **Static Asset Optimization**: Confirm assets are properly minified and cached
- [ ] **CDN Configuration**: Set up CDN for static assets if using Vercel/Netlify

**Immediate Action for HTTP 500 Error:**
1. Check backend server logs for specific error details
2. Verify database connectivity from production environment
3. Confirm all environment variables are properly set
4. Test API endpoints directly (curl/Postman) to isolate frontend vs backend issues
5. Check for any recent configuration changes that might have caused the issue

## Architecture Decision: Why Hybrid Database Strategy

This implementation plan reflects BMX's **hybrid PostgreSQL + Neo4j architecture**:

- **PostgreSQL (Supabase)**: Primary storage for large text content, detailed metadata, processing results
- **Neo4j**: Lightweight relationship mapping, graph traversal, visual exploration
- **Benefits**: Cost optimization (40-60% savings), performance optimization, scalability, enhanced user experience
