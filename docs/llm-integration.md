# LLM Integration Principles

This document outlines the principles, patterns, and best practices for integrating Google Gemini API into BMX's knowledge processing pipeline.

## Core Principles

BMX's LLM integration prioritizes these output characteristics in order:

1. **Factual**: Accurate to source material, no hallucinations
2. **Verifiable**: Traceable to original sources with clear attribution
3. **Holistic**: Leverages graph connections for comprehensive understanding
4. **Concise**: Effectively summarized while preserving essential information

## LLM Choice: Google Gemini API

**Rationale:**
- Strong performance on complex reasoning tasks
- Excellent integration with Google Cloud ecosystem
- Competitive pricing for production usage
- Good handling of long context windows for document processing

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Document Summarization
**Use Case:** Condense large documents into structured summaries

**Pattern:**
```python
prompt = """Summarize the core arguments, key findings, and main topics of the following text. 
Identify the primary purpose or thesis if apparent. 
Aim for a concise yet comprehensive summary (300-500 words).

Text: {document_content}
"""
```

**Output Format:** Structured text with clear sections for main arguments, key findings, and conclusions.

### 2. Entity & Relationship Extraction
**Use Case:** Extract structured knowledge elements from text

**Pattern:**
```python
prompt = """From the following text, identify key named entities and relationships.
Output as JSON with 'entities' and 'relationships' keys.

Entity types: Person, Organization, Concept, Theory, Publication, Location
Relationship types: DISCUSSES, CITES, CRITIQUES, EXPANDS_ON, CONTRASTS_WITH

Text: {summary_or_content}
"""
```

**Output Format:** Structured JSON for direct database integration.

### 3. Cross-Document Analysis
**Use Case:** Identify connections between documents in the knowledge graph

**Pattern:**
```python
prompt = """Compare these documents and identify connections, similarities, and contrasts.
Focus on shared entities, complementary arguments, and intellectual relationships.

Document 1: {doc1_summary}
Document 2: {doc2_summary}
"""
```

**Output Format:** Structured analysis highlighting connections for graph relationship creation.

### 4. Query Enhancement
**Use Case:** Improve user queries by leveraging graph context

**Pattern:**
```python
prompt = """Using the following knowledge graph context, provide a comprehensive answer to the user's question.
Include relevant entities, relationships, and source attribution.

Context: {graph_context}
Question: {user_question}
"""
```

**Output Format:** Natural language response with clear source attribution.

## Quality Assurance

### Source Attribution
- Always include source document references in LLM outputs
- Maintain traceability from generated content back to original sources
- Use structured metadata to track provenance chains

### Hallucination Prevention
- Use specific, constrained prompts that focus on source material
- Implement confidence scoring for extracted entities and relationships
- Cross-validate LLM outputs against source documents
- Use temperature settings that favor accuracy over creativity

### Consistency Checks
- Compare entity extractions across similar documents
- Validate relationship types against predefined schemas
- Monitor for contradictory information across the knowledge base

## Error Handling

### API Failures
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Graceful degradation when LLM services are unavailable
- Fallback to rule-based processing for critical operations

### Content Validation
- Validate JSON outputs against expected schemas
- Handle malformed responses with appropriate error logging
- Retry with modified prompts for consistently problematic content

### Performance Monitoring
- Track API response times and token usage
- Monitor extraction quality metrics
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns or failures

## Cost Optimization

### Token Management
- Optimize prompt length while maintaining effectiveness
- Use document chunking for very large texts
- Cache frequent queries and common extractions

### Batch Processing
- Group similar operations to reduce API overhead
- Use asynchronous processing for non-interactive operations
- Implement intelligent queuing for workload management

### Model Selection
- Use appropriate model variants based on task complexity
- Consider local models for simple extraction tasks
- Balance cost with accuracy requirements

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Reasoning
- Chain-of-thought prompting for complex analysis
- Multi-step reasoning for knowledge synthesis
- Collaborative filtering with graph algorithms

### Specialized Models
- Fine-tuned models for domain-specific extraction
- Custom prompts for different document types
- Adaptive processing based on content characteristics

### Integration Patterns
- Real-time processing for live content streams
- Incremental updates for evolving knowledge bases
- Cross-modal processing for multimedia content

This framework ensures that LLM integration enhances BMX's knowledge processing capabilities while maintaining high standards for accuracy, traceability, and system reliability.
