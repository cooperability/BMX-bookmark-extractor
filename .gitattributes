# Normalize all text files to LF line endings in the repository and working directory.
# This helps prevent mixed line endings.
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicitly ensure shell scripts have LF, though the above should cover them.
*.sh text eol=lf
*.bash text eol=lf

# Add other file types that MUST have specific line endings if necessary below.
# For example, Windows batch files might need CRLF:
# *.bat text eol=crlf
